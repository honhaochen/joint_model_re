hence , white catfish particles help to guide the particles , which can be not in a local optimum , to new regions of the search path — thus leading to possible better areas .
only if the pressure inside the cavity becomes reduced and many cells begin to grow , in this stage , the frozen layer is almost fully formed , and the migration of cells to the surface is avoided , resulting in a more uniform surface finish with improved rugosity [ 44 ] . Potential further variation to diminish surface defects covers the mold opening aging , which is applied by completely filling the cavity with polymer melt , ensuring higher melt efficiency , and delaying the cell growth while the polymer melt in contact with the mold wall freezes , the defects caused by the process .
it can avoid defects caused by melting / solidification or fusion welding and produce very accurate residual stress and lower
a minor difference to the specific types of data impu - tation is that the interpolation methods are fully automated , whereas replacing missing data by random noise may generate changes dependant on properties of a random numbers generator .
