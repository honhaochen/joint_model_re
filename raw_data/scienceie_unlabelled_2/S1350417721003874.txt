Recently, environmental pollution has increased significantly due to petroleum-based fuels widely used in ve-
hicles. This environmental pollution is mainly due to the acidic SO2 gas generated by the combustion of fuels and 
emitted into the atmosphere. SO2 gas causes not only acid rain but also corrosion of metal parts of engines in 
vehicles. In addition, it functions as a catalyst poison in catalytic converters in exhaust system. Due to these 
damages, strict regulations have been introduced to reduce the amount of sulfur in fuels. As of 2005, the 
permissible amount of sulfur in diesel fuels in Europe and America has been limited to 10 and 15 ppm by weight, 
respectively. 
Due to the decreasing oil reserves in the world, high viscosity petroleums containing high sulfur and heavier 
fractions (i.e., low-quality oils) are increasing, thus making desulfurization difficult and leading to high costly 
process. Since time and economic loss are very important today, these two terms have to be reduced to a 
minimum. Recently, ultrasound wave in ODS shown as an alternative to HDS is utilized to further increase 
desulfurization in shorter times. Ultrasound wave locally creates high temperatures and high pressures (hot-spot 
theory) in liquid, causing the desulfurization reaction to accelerate further. 
In this review, the advantages and difficulties of oxidative desulfurization, the economics of ultrasound- 
assisted oxidative desulfurization are summarized and recommendations for improving the process are 
presented.   
Today, lower quality fuels (high viscosity) containing high amounts 
of sulfur are extracted due to decreasing oil reserves [1]. As it is known, 
when fuels are burned, organic sulfur compounds in them are oxidized 
and emit SO2 gas which is harmful to the atmosphere and the environ-
ment, and these gases cause acid rain and corrosion [2]. Therefore, it is 
of crucial importance to desulfurize these low quality fuels. 
Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) as conventional desulfurization is 
widely used in the world. In HDS, organic sulfur compounds react with 
H2 gas and H2S is released as a result of the carbon–sulfur bond cleavage 
in organic compound [3]. However, HDS has some disadvantages [4–6]: 
the use of high temperature, high pressure, expensive H2 gas and 
expensive catalysts with high chemical stability and high thermal 
resistance that must not be affected by severe operating conditions. Also, 
aliphatic sulfur compounds are easy to remove in HDS, while refractory 
aromatic sulfur compounds are difficult to remove [7]. 
To eliminate these disadvantages, alternative desulfurization pro-
cesses such as adsorptive desulfurization [8], extractive desulfurization 
[9], oxidative desulfurization [10], biodesulfurization [11] are used. 
Among them, the most advantageous and promising method is oxidative 
desulfurization (ODS). In ODS, at relatively low temperatures such as 
20–60 ◦C, at atmospheric or near atmospheric pressures, organic sulfur 
compounds are oxidized by using H2O2 and a catalyst to convert first to 
their sulfoxides and then to their sulfones, which are more polar com-
pounds, and finally these oxidized sulfur compounds are removed from 
the fuel by extraction with a polar extractant such as methanol, aceto-
nitrile, dimethyl formamide etc. or by adsorption [12]. 
Desulfurization is also carried out with simultaneous oxidation and 
extraction [13]. In HDS, it is difficult to remove aromatic sulfur com-
pounds, especially alkyl-substituted aromatic sulfur compounds which 
are prevented from accessing into the catalyst pores due to steric hin-
drance [14]. On the contrary, in ODS, using a liquid homogeneous 
catalytic system such as formic acid or acetic acid- H2O2 (HP) oxidant
[15], alkyl-substituted aromatic sulfur derivatives are easier to remove 
due to an increase in electron density [1,16–19] on the sulfur atom as 
shown in Fig. 1. In particular, bonding the naphthenic ring to the thio-
phenic ring significantly increases the ODS yield of the compounds such 
as THBNT, THDBT and OHDNT [20]. When the phosphotungstic acid- 
HP system is used, the molecular size of the catalyst becomes impor-
tant. Since phosphotungstic acid is a bulky molecule [21], the ODS 
reactivity of aromatic sulfur compounds having alkyl groups adjacent to 
the sulfur atom decreases due to spatial obstacle [22]. In a study [23] in 
which ODS of model sulfur compounds was performed by phospho-
tungstic acid-HP, it was reported that sulfur removal decreased in the 
order DBT > 4-MDBT > 4,6-DMDBT. When the solid heterogeneous 
catalyst is used, the sulfur atom is prevented from entering the catalyst 
pore and its interaction with the sulfur atom due to the steric hindrance 
of alkyl groups adjacent to sulfur becomes weak, consequently causing a 
decline in the ODS reactivity [24]. Desulfurization using t-butylhy-
droperoxide in the presence of Mo/Al2O3 catalyst is in the order 
DBT > 4-MDBT > 4,6-DMDBT≫ BT [25]. With the use of TiO2 anatase- 
supported V2O5 catalyst and HP, the ODS yield is in the order 
DBT > BT > 4-MDBT > 2-MT > 2,5-DMT > 4,6-DMDBT [26]. In the 
H3PW12O40/TiO2-HP system, the desulfurization at 30 ◦C increases in 
the order 4,6-DMDBT < BT <DBT [27]. 
In ODS reactions, the mixture consists of two immiscible liquid 
phases as organic phase (real fuel or model fuel solution containing 
sulfur compounds such as DBT, 4,6-DMDBT dissolved in a non-polar 
solvent such as n-hexane, n-heptane or iso-octane) and aqueous phase 
(H2O2 solution). Therefore, quaternary ammonium salts as phase 
transfer catalysts (PTCs), one end of which is hydrophilic and the other 
end hydrophobic, are generally used, reducing the liquid–liquid inter-
face tension [28] and enabling the transfer of oxidizing species to 
organic phase, so that the ODS increases significantly [29]. Sometimes 
using ionic liquid (IL) instead of aqueous phase, ODS is further increased 
such that the IL acts as extractant during oxidation [30]. For the last 
20–30 years, ultrasound wave has been used to accelerate oxidation 
reactions and increase ODS more. Sonication has two simultaneous ef-
fects in accelerating ODS reactions. The ultrasound wave creates cavi-
tation bubbles in liquid and the implosion of these bubbles produces 
very high temperatures and pressures locally in the liquid. At the 
extremely high temperatures, chemical bonds of organic compounds are 
broken and reactive radicals are generated (Sonochemical effect). 
Microjet, microturbulence and shock waves created by imploding 
cavitation bubbles significantly accelerate the mass transfer by 
increasing the emulsification of the organic and aqueous phase (Sono-
physical effect). Thus higher desulfurization efficiencies are achieved in 
a shorter time [31]. 
ODS reactions are generally heterogeneous reactions, i.e., there are 
two or more phases in the mixture that are immiscible with each other. 
The solution of the organic phase, which is formed by dissolving model 
sulfur compounds in a non-polar solvent such as hexane, heptane or 
toluene, has been referred as to denotations such as model fuel, model 
diesel, model liquid fuel, model sulfur solution. The aqueous phase 
consists of an oxidant and a catalyst. In many studies, the reactivity of 
the model sulfur compounds has been determined and the optimum 
conditions (temperature, oxidant volume, catalyst amount, organic 
phase/aqueous phase volume ratio, time etc.) for maximum desulfur-
ization have been found. These conditions have then been applied to real 
fuels to achieve desulfurization. 
Many solid, liquid and gas oxidizers have been evaluated. Inorganic 
chemicals such as oxone [32], sodium persulfate [33], potassium su-
peroxide [34], potassium dichromate [35], sodium percarbonate [36], 
sodium perchlorate [37], hydrogen peroxide [38], sodium hypochlorite 
[39], solid oxidizers such as cyclohexanone peroxide [40] and organic 
chemicals such as t-butylhydroperoxide [41] and cumene hydroperox-
ide [42] as liquid oxidizers are used. The most distinctive feature of 
cyclohexanone peroxide as solid organic oxidizers and cumene hydro-
peroxide and t-butylhydroperoxide as liquid organic oxidizers is that 
they can all dissolve in the organic phase or fuel, thereby directly 
oxidizing sulfur compounds [43,44]. The structural formulas of 
oxidizing substances are shown in Fig. 2. Gaseous oxidants are generally 
oxygen [45], nitrogen dioxide [46] and ozone [47], and the solubility 
[48–51] of these gases in non-polar solvents is generally higher than that 
in water. 
Catalysts used in ODS are divided into two types; homogeneous 
catalysts soluble in liquid phase and heterogeneous catalysts insoluble in 
liquid phase.

2. Types of catalysts in UAODS 
2.1. Heterogeneous catalysts 
Catalysts used in heterogeneous catalysis are solid and insoluble in 
liquid mixture [52]. Nanoparticles improve the adsorption of sulfur 
compounds due to their large surface area [53]. Photocatalyst under UV 
[54] or visible light [55], nano-sized silica particles including meso-
porous silica [56], aluminum oxide particles [57], transition metal ox-
ides [58], activated carbons [59], modified metal–organic frameworks 
[60], Ni catalyst also called sponge metal [61], nanocomposite [62], 
graphene oxide [63], activated carbon (AC)-supported phosphotungstic 
acid [64] and fly ash-modified fenton catalysts [65] are used. In the case 
of using heterogeneous catalysts, the catalytic ODS mechanism [66–70] 
is illustrated in Scheme 1. DBT, which is transferred from the organic 
phase to the aqueous bulk phase by ultrasound, diffuses to the outer 
surface of the solid catalyst by passing across the liquid film (boundary 
layer) around the supported catalyst particle. DBT is adsorbed on active 
sites on the external surface of the catalyst or on active sites on the in-
ternal surface of the inner pores by diffusing through the pore. HP in-
teracts with active sites on the inner and outer surface and forms 
oxidizing active complexes. After DBT adsorbed on these active centers 
is converted into its sulfones by undergoing an oxidation reaction, DBT 
sulfone is desorbed and transferred successively to the boundary layer, 
aqueous phase and organic phase. In addition to enhancement of 
adsorption and desorption, ultrasound significantly increases not only 
the external and internal diffusion but also the collision frequency of 
reactants with active sites, thus causing increased UAODS performance. 
2.1.1. Photocatalysts 
Matsuzawa et al. [71] carried out the photocatalytic oxidation of 
DBT using a Hg-Xe lamp of 200 W at wavelength > 290 nm in the 
presence of anatase-type TiO2 (P25) as a heterogeneous photocatalyst 
and air (in which oxygen acts as an electron scavenger [72], thus causing 
oxidation only by electron vacancy (h+) [73] of TiO2 [74–76]) in a polar 
acetonitrile solution. They found the photooxidation rate in combina-
tion with H2O2, photocatalyst and indirect ultrasound (45 kHz and 
50 W) was higher than the oxidation rate with H2O2 and photocatalyst, 
and this effect was due to the reactivation of the TiO2 surface and 
increased mass transfer. However, they stated that the direct oxidation 
rate of 4,6-DMDBT using only H2O2 under photoirradiation was higher 
than the photooxidation rates in the cases of HP-photocatalyst-US and 
HP-photocatalyst. In addition, it is reported that the oxidation reaction 
rate of the methyl group in 4,6-DMDBT increased by using aliphatic and 
cyclic alkanes as a non-polar solvent instead of the polar solvent 
acetonitrile, since oxygen was more soluble in non-polar solvents [77]. 
In another study [78], using photocatalytic anatase TiO2, 30 wt% HP 
and ultrasound with duty cycle, the catalytic oxidative desulfurization of 
gum turpentine, which is similar to crude sulphated turpentine and a by- 
product of Kraft process [79] to obtain wood pulp, spiked with dimethyl 
disulfide was investigated and a desulfurization efficiency of 100% was 
found at 28 ◦C, 120 W power dissipation and 20 kHz US frequency, 70% 
duty cycle, 15 g L–1 HP concentration, 4 g L–1 TiO2 loading for 50 ppmw 
DMDS initial concentration. Also, it was reported that total treatment 
cost (0.31 $ L–1) with (US +H2O2 + TiO2) system is less as compared to 
US, only 30 wt% H2O2, only Fenton, only TiO2, US + 30 wt% H2O2, 
US + Fenton and US + TiO2. In addition, the authors investigated the 4
effects of individually US/Fenton and US/TiO2 processes on desulfur-
ization, but it was found that the desulfurization efficiencies of those 
processes were lower than the desulfurization efficiency of the US/HP/ 
TiO2 process. It has been explained that the reason for the very high 
desulfurization of the US/HP/TiO2 process is the production of more 
hydroxyl radicals from HP along with the support of the TiO2 catalyst 
and the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals as a result of the in-
crease of active sites by deformation of the catalyst under US. It was also 
stated that homogeneous distribution of the catalyst particles and better 
mixing due to the high turbulence caused by the collapsed bubbles 
enhance the sulfur removal. Cavitational yields (4.65 × 10–9, 
4.71 × 10–9 and 6.61 × 10–9 g J− 1 for US/Fenton reagent, US/TiO2 and 
US/HP/TiO2, respectively) were calculated by the authors to confirm 
the differences in desulfurization in the three processes. In this study, it 
was determined that the total cost of the other treatment methods was 
2.22, 43.12, 14.69, 17.50, 1.255, 0.70 and 0.595 $ L− 1 for US, only HP 
(30%(v/v), only Fenton, only TiO2, US +HP(30%(v/v), US + Fenton 
and US + TiO2, respectively. Although a high sulfur removal is obtained 
from gum turpentine in the presence HP and TiO2 under US, oxidative 
desulfurization of DMDS as an aliphatic sulfur compound is quite easy, 
the initial sulfur quantity (50 ppm DMDS) is very low, and the reaction 
time is 120 min. Therefore, it is not a favorable method. 
In the studies performed by Yu et al. [80] and Zhao et al. [81], 
sonophotocatalytic oxidative desulfurization of hydrotreated diesel oil 
and model diesel oil using CdO as semiconductor and H2O2 as oxidant 
was investigated and desulfurization efficiencies were found to be 72.7 
and 99.47%, respectively. The high desulfurization in the latter under 
20 kHz and 150 W US can be attributed to primarily the use of the model 
sulfur solution prepared by dissolving the organosulfur compound in a 
solvent instead of hydrogenated diesel fuel, which consists of a complex 
mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons [82], and 
acetic acid to increase the oxidizing power of H2O2 and secondarily to 
the catalyst with a smaller grain size (i.e. larger surface area) and more 
homogenized structure, which is synthesized under ultrasound [83], 
hence causing a higher catalytic activity. 
Behin and Farhadian [84] performed the ODS (followed by 
extraction with a binary solvent of methanol and water in ratio of 1:1 in 
volume) of nonhydrotreated kerosene with a total S content of 1553 
ppmw at 0.05 cm s− 1 superficial gas velocity for 15 min. by passing 
ozone as a homogeneous photocatalyst through an airlift reactor and 
using H2O2 under both US of 20 kHz frequency (60 W power) and UV in 
a wavelength range of 280–400 nm. Despite a 48% loss of aromaticity 
due to ozone, and to a lesser extent polar solvent, a desulfurization ef-
ficiency of 91.7% was reached. It is revealed that the high desulfuriza-
tion yield at optimum conditions was due to HO· (oxidation potential 
[85] of hydroxyl radical, 2.80 V) and HO2⋅ (oxidation potential [85] of 
hydroperoxyl radical, 1.7 V) radicals formed in the mixture during the 
reaction rather than the increased mass transfer and the physical prop-
erties of raw kerosene are almost unchanged. 
In addition, sonolysis of sulfur compounds in water was carried out 
at high ultrasonic frequencies without using catalysts and oxidants. The 
dilute solution containing 21.46 ppm S BT in water was subjected to 
sonodegradation at 21 ◦C under 352 kHz and 80 W US, and it was 
explained that the dominant mechanism was the oxidation of BT as a 
result of the formation of hydroxyl radicals from water [86]. However, 
in the sonolysis of a dilute T solution containing 32 ppm S in water at 
22 ◦C under 850 kHz and 40 W US power, it was revealed that the 
dominant mechanism was pyrolysis as a result of high temperature 
caused by collapsed cavitation bubbles rather than hydroxyl radical 
formed in the medium since T can diffuse readily into the cavitation 
bubble due to T’s lower boiling point (i.e., more volatile) than BT [87]. 
AOPs were utilized in combination with sonolysis. Despite high 
desulfurization under both US and UV or visible light in AOPs 
[71,80,81], where photocatalysts are used, these high desulfurization 
yields were reached in 6,5 and 3 h, respectively, for the respective 
studies. In photocatalysis, a light energy such as UV or visible light is 
absorbed by photocatalyst (e.g., TiO2), and the electron is excited by 
passing from the valence band to the conduction band, and thus an 
electron-hole pair is formed on photocatalyst. The positive electron 
holes (h+) react with the water adsorbed on the catalyst to produce 
hydroxyl radicals. In addition, oxygen on catalyst surface reacts in series 
with the excited electron (e–) to produce hydroxyl radicals and also US 
Scheme 1. The ODS mechanism with heterogeneous catalysts.  
generates hydroxyl radical from HP. Consequently, enhanced hydroxyl 
radical production renders sonophotocatalytic ODS yield high. The re-
actions are as follows [88,89]: 
Photocatalyst ̅→
+ hν e− + h+
H2O + h+ → H++ HO•
2H2O + 2h+ →H2O2 + 2H+
H2O2 ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅→
)))
2HO⋅  
O2 + e− →O⋅−
2 ̅̅̅→
2H++ e− H2O2 ̅̅̅→
H++ e− HO⋅ +H2O 
In the Sono-Fenton process, FeSO4 is used along with HP under US 
irradiation. In the Fenton reaction, Fe2+ is first oxidized by HP to pro-
duce the HO⋅ radical and then the reaction of Fe3+ with HP produces the 
complex intermediate Fe-OOH2+ which decomposes rapidly to form 
HO2⋅ radical and Fe2+ under US [90]. Fenton reaction is substantially 
accelerated by US [91]. As a result, sulfur removal further increases due 
to enhancement of hydroxyl radicals in organic-aqueous phase interfa-
cial area. The medium must be acidic to maximize production of free 
radicals [92]. The reactions in the Sonofenton process are as follows 
[93]: 
Fe2+ + H2O2 →Fe3+ + HO⋅+ OH−
Fe3+ + H2O2 →Fe - OOH2+ + H+
Fe - OOH2+ ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅→
)))
Fe2+ + HO2⋅ 
As noted above, reaction times are very high in studies [71,80,81], 
where photocatalyst was used. Therefore, this will lead to higher elec-
trical energy consumption for US, UV and heating, if any, increasing the 
operating cost in AOP. 
In the study [84], in which ozone and HP were used as oxidant under 
US-UV, it was explained that the reason for high sulfur removal in a 
short time was indirect hydroxyl radical production from O3 and direct 
hydroxyl radical from HP by UV and US. In addition, it is stated that 
ultrasound greatly accelerates the gas–liquid mass transfer through 
micro-streaming produced by the violent collapse of bubbles and allows 
ozone to react with sulfur compounds by increasing the gas–liquid 
interfacial area. Moreover, dissolved ozone gas acts as nucleation sites to 
form cavitation bubbles, causing the formation of more cavitation 
bubbles [94]. Thus, this synergistic effect accelerates significantly the 
ultrasound-assisted photo oxidative desulfurization reaction rate. 
In a sonophoto-fenton process [95] in which oxalic acid was used, a 
sulfur removal of>93% was achieved from 100 ppm DBT in toluene at 
0.05 mol L− 1 Fe2+ concentration, 0.15 mol L− 1 oxalate concentration, 
pH = 2, a volume ratio (organic phase/HP) of 10:1, 25 ◦C and 15 min 
under both 37 kHz, 95 W indirect US and UV in the presence of air. It 
was revealed that FeII(C2O4), which is formed by the reaction of Fe2+
with oxalate anion (C2O4
2− ) in the reaction medium, as well as 
FeII(C2O4)
2−
2 complex which is formed by the reaction of FeII(C2O4) with 
C2O4
2− , is responsible for this high desulfurization. The authors reported 
that FeII(C2O4) and FeII(C2O4)
2−
2 caused the formation of HO⋅, HO2⋅ and 
O⋅ radicals in the aqueous phase to oxidize DBT under US and UV irra-
diation. It was stated that Fe(II)-oxalate complex as catalyst can be 
reused three times (a decrease of 1.33 and 1.56% for the first and second 
run, respectively) without significantly losing its activity by regenerat-
ing it after each reaction. 
2.1.2. Solid catalysts 
The effect of solid catalysts to increase ODS has also been studied 
[96], and it was found that the use of US for total desulfurization of 2,3- 
DMBT and 2,3,7-TMBT, which are the two most abundant components 
in JP-8 fuel, in the presence of H2O2, formic acid and phosphoric acid- 
activated carbon increases the total desulfurization in the absence of 
US (mechanical stirring) by around 2.4-fold. It is also reported that 
desulfurization by chemically activated carbon (MW-99) with phos-
phoric acid is superior to desulfurization by thermally activated carbon 
(Norit SX-1) due to the larger surface area of MW-99 and the greater 
number of its surface acid centers. Sulfur removal of 98 and 94% (fol-
lowed by adsorption with activated alumina) from JP-8 and diesel, 
respectively, was performed with MW-99 under optimum conditions 
(65 ◦C, 2 h, 60% amplitude, 20 kHz sonication, pH = 1.4). 
Khlaif and Bded [97] carried out the ODS (followed by extraction) of 
crude oil containing 1.95% total S by weight in the presence of US and 
AC using different volumes of acetic acid and 50 wt% H2O2. As a result 
of the increase of the amount of AC used from 3 to 9 g, the number of 
active sites in AC increased, thus improving ODS and an optimum 
desulfurization of 81.325% was obtained by using 9 g AC, 40 mL H2O2, 
30 mL acetic acid at 50 ◦C. 
Using phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40@ TMU-17-NH2) incorpo-
rated in robust zinc-based MOF with enhanced efficiency as a solid 
catalyst, simultaneous extraction and oxidation of model oil containing 
BT, DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, each of which has concentration of 500 mg 
L–1, were performed in the presence of acetonitrile under indirect son-
ication of 37 kHz [98]. Although the pore volume and surface area 
(137 cm3 g− 1 and 814 m2 g− 1) of the composite MOF catalyst formed by 
encapsulating H3PW12O40 in TMU-17-NH2 were lower as compared to 
those of the neat MOF (239 cm3 g− 1 and 1050 m2 g− 1), a sulfur removal 
of 98, 87 and 71% was reached with 20 mg of the MOF composite 
containing 20 wt% phosphotungstic acid at model oil/MeCN 1:1 vol 
ratio, O/S ratio of 2:1 and room temperature for DBT, 4,6-DMDBT and 
BT, respectively, at the end of 15 min. The reason for the lower reactivity 
of 4,6-DMDBT compared to DBT is that the alkyl substituted aromatic 
compound is sterically prevented from entering the 3D framework. Also 
lower desulfurization was achieved with DMF solvent instead of MeCN 
depending on the fact that adsorption of solvent on the heterogeneous 
catalyst increases with increasing boiling point [99,100] and polarity 
[101–103]. The low desulfurization with DMF can be attributed to the 
fact that not only the boiling point of DMF (153 ◦C) is significantly 
higher than that of MeCN (82 ◦C) [104] but also higher polarity [105] of 
the former compared to the latter causes stronger interaction with Zn2+
in the modified MOF composite [106], thus reducing adsorption of DBT. 
The former is bound to Zn2+ cations in the MOF composite [106]. The 
three possible adsorption mechanisms [107,108] are π-π interaction 
between sulfur compounds and aromatic rings of modified MOF, 
hydrogen bonding between NH2 groups and S, and strong Zn2+-S 
interaction between phosphotungstic acid-TMU-17-NH2 and aromatic 
sulfur compounds. TMU-17-NH2 is probably structurally similar to 
TMU-16-NH2 with positive zeta potential [109]. H2O2 and aromatic 
sulfur compounds are adsorbed on the catalyst, the phosphotungstic 
acid anion is oxidized with hydrogen peroxide and as a consequence, the 
polyoxoperoxo complex anion formed oxidizes aromatic sulfur com-
pounds [110]. In addition, water in the reaction medium can result in 
the radical decomposition of H2O2 by forming an aqueous complex with 
Zn2+ in Zn(II)-based MOF, hence generating a strong oxidant radical 
HO·[111] and electrophilic activation of hydrogen peroxide to convert 
sulfur compounds to their sulfoxides as oxidized sulfur compounds is 
caused by Zn-based MOF [112]. 
Metalloporphyrin [113] and metallophthalocyanine [114] catalysts, 
which are metal complexes, are also used in ODS reactions. Metal 
removal from the latter is not easy compared to the former [115]. The 
degree of ODS can be changed by adding different electron-withdrawing 
or electron-donating substituents to these complexes [113,116]. In 
addition, the stability of these complexes can be increased by forming 
nanocomposite catalysts, thus ensuring that they can be reused in 
oxidation reactions [117]. 
Wang et al. fulfilled two separate studies [118,119] concerning 
sonocatalytic ODS (followed by extraction with methanol) of 
benzothiophene in the presence of H2O2 at 60 ◦C using core–shell 
nanosphere modified with metallophthalocyanine (tetra-substituted 
carboxyl iron phthalocyanine, FeC4Pc) encapsulated into magnetic 
mesopore silica nanoparticles and silica nanotube catalyst with 
magnetite nanoparticles-coated interior surface and FeC4Pc-modified 
inner and outer surface. Higher desulfurization of the former (at the 
same conditions, desulfurization near 94.5%) compared to the latter 
(76% desulfurization yield at 30 min and molar ratio of H2O2/S = 15) 
can be considerably clarified by the fact that the particle size (60 nm) 
and the average pore size (2.6 nm) of the nanosphere composite catalyst 
are smaller than the outer diameter of the nanotube catalyst (200 nm), 
hence providing larger surface area for adsorption, though the catalyst 
loading is not specified in the latter. In these two studies, it was reported 
that high desulfurization is due to the radical decomposition of H2O2 to 
HO· on metallophthalocyanines. HO· radical from H2O2 by ultrasound 
wave can also be formed [120]. It is also stated that both catalysts can be 
easily isolated from the mixture by applying an external magnetic field 
after the reactions due to their superparamagnetic properties and reused 
in the next reactions. 
Uniform Ni skeletal catalyst was synthesized at a size of 2.5–10 µm 
under 90 kHz ultrasound and crude oil containing 2.645% S by weight is 
subjected to oxidation with two treatment cycles using a mixture of 
ozone-air and 0.2% by weight catalyst based on the oil volume for 5 min 
in a US bath with frequency of 22 kHz [61]. Sulfur removals from gas-
oline and diesel fractions in crude oil were found to be 52 and 27.4%, 
respectively, as well as improvement of gasoline and diesel fractions. 
By using 0.5 g of the modified GO/COOH solid catalyst with 
increased surface acidity formed by the addition of –CH2COOH group to 
the epoxy or hydroxyl groups of GO as a result of the reaction of gra-
phene oxide (GO) with chloroacetic acid, a desulfurization of 95%, 
which is higher than desulfurization in the case of using non-acidified 
GO, was performed from the DBT solution containing 1000 ppm S 
with 30 wt% H2O2 within 300 min on sonication [121]. It was put for-
ward that the adsorption-oxidation mechanism is the conversion of DBT 
to DBT sulfone by the peroxyacid group formed on the GO/COOH sur-
face via activation of H2O2 by the carboxyl group in GO, and then π-π 
interaction of DBT sulfone with GO/COOH and adsorption of DBT sul-
fone through hydrogen bonding. In addition, it was stated that ultra-
sound contributes to high desulfurization due to the increase in the 
surface area caused by the exfoliation of GO/COOH as well as the 
increased collision frequency of the reactants due to the significantly 
increased mass transfer. 
As phosphotungstic acid hydrate as oxidizing agent is dissolved in 
the aqueous phase, thus making it difficult to be reused by recovery 
[122], activated carbon-supported phosphotungstic acid (PTA) catalysts 
were synthesized and two separate studies [123,124] were carried out 
on UAODS of 2000 ppmw DBT. In the first study [123], a DBT conver-
sion of 93.4% was reached using 40 mL of model oil, at PTA/AC-10 
catalyst/model oil 1.25: 100 mass ratio and H2O2/model oil 0.1 vol 
ratio under 70 W US power at 60 ◦C and 10 min, while in the second 
study [124] under the same conditions except the use of US at 100 W 
power, DBT conversion well below the conversion reached in the first 
study was obtained. The reason for the low conversion can be attributed 
to the weakening of the ultrasound wave (bubble shielding effect) as a 
consequence of absorption and scattering of US waves by these bubbles 
by resulting in the formation of dense cavitation bubble cloud around 
the transducer under high power [125]. Therefore, an optimum power 
intensity is needed as an important factor for high conversion in liquid 
phase reactions. In both studies, it was reported that desulfurization 
improved due to the increase in the number of surface acid sites by the 
increase in the amount of phosphotungstic acid in AC, and beyond a 
certain phosphotungstic acid amount, the sulfur removal is unchanged 
due to the reduction in surface area as a result of the destruction of 
microchannels in AC and the occupation of pores in AC by phospho-
tungstic acid. 
In a similar study [126] where the same catalyst (HPW/AC-10) was 
synthesized, the optimum conditions were determined using RSM for 
reasonable desulfurization of the model oil containing 2800 ppm S 
consisting of a mixture of DBT, BT and T in the presence of individually, 
30, 20 and 10 wt% H2O2 at different catalyst quantities, different AP/OP 
volume ratios and different times under 37 kHz US. By applying these 
optimum parameters to kerosene with 1370 ppmw S, a 99% desulfur-
ization was successfully achieved, followed by four-cycle extraction. 
In a study [127] where O2 in air was used as oxidant instead of 
thermally unstable H2O2, modified heteropolyacid catalysts 
(H5PV2Mo10O40/SiO2 and H5PV2W10O40/SiO2) supported on silica were 
synthesized. At optimum conditions (catalyst weight/model oil volume 
11.09 g L–1, POM weight /SiO2 (wt. %) 39.879, sonication time 
199.209 min.) found using the response surface method at 65 ◦C and 1.3 
L min− 1 air flow rate, a higher desulfurization (90 vs. 70%) of DBT was 
achieved in a shorter time (199 vs. 360 min.) under 20 kHz and 360 W 
direct US compared to the desulfurization in the case in which ultra-
sound is not used. It was demonstrated that the reason for low desul-
furization is the polymerization of DBT due to the low concentration of 
oxygen dissolved in the organic phase (limited aerobic medium) under 
magnetic stirring, thus causing the polymer formed to accumulate on the 
modified heteropolyacids. While this polymerization is thought to be 
probably initiated by the DBT cation radical formed as a result of elec-
tron transfer from DBT to vanadium incorporated heteropolyacid [128], 
it was found that US increases the dissolved oxygen concentration and 
prevents polymer deposition on the catalyst surface. DBT conversion 
10% more with H5PV2W10O40/SiO2 than the conversion percentage 
with H5PV2Mo10O40/SiO2 was obtained since the standard reduction 
potential of V5+ and W6+ (1 and − 0.090 eV, respectively) is higher than 
that of Mo6+ (-0.913 eV), thus having stronger oxidizing power 
[129,130]. The oxidation mechanism [131,132] in the UAODS system 
can be elucidated by the electron transfer-oxygen transfer (ET-OT) re-
action, in which oxygen is involved, between the modified hetero-
polyacid and DBT as follows:

Model oil with 1000 ppm total S content containing BT, DBT and 4,6- 
DMDBT was sonicated at 300 W, 45% amplitude and 20 kHz fixed fre-
quency using 30 wt% H2O2 in the presence of MoO3 supported on 
γ-Al2O3 catalyst for 30 min [133] and at the optimum conditions (H2O2/ 
S = 3 molar ratio, 45 ◦C, 30 g L–1 catalyst/model oil ratio) found by RSM 
with central composite design, a DBT → DBT sulphone conversion above 
98% was found. Moreover, a desulfurization improvement of over 95% 
was achieved for DBT even after 6 cycles without losing the catalyst 
effect, due to US, which prevents the agglomeration of catalyst particles 
and H2O2 and causes desorption of adsorbed polar sulfones and water 
impurities from the catalyst surface. For BT, DBT and 4,6-DMDBT, the 
highest desulfurization was achieved when the MoO3 content on the 
catalyst was 10 wt% and at this loading, it was proved by XRD analysis 
that MoO3 is homogeneously dispersed on the support and MoO3 crys-
tals are not seen. It was suggested that the sulfur compounds are 
oxidized by highly reactive molybdenum peroxide and molybdenum 
diperoxides formed in situ. 
In a similar study [134] where the same reagents and the same ul-
trasonic parameters were used, complete oxidation of DBT in the model 
oil containing 600 ppmw total S was achieved in the presence of MoO3 
loading of 10 wt.%/Al2O3 at H2O2/S = 3.8 molar ratio, 30 g L–1 catalyst/ 
model oil ratio, 45 ◦C and 30 min. Besides, the addition of aromatic 
compounds (tetralin, naphthalene and 2-methyl naphthalene) 
A. Tugrul Albayrak and A. Tavman                                                                                                           
individually to the model oil formed by dissolving DBT in hexane to 
mimic diesel fuel appreciably reduced the UAODS yield although the 
resulting DBT selectivity is high due to the competitive adsorption of the 
aromatic compounds on the catalyst surface. Further, in both studies 
[133,134] it was shown that the active sites responsible for the 
adsorption of sulfur compounds are tetrahedrally coordinated Mo6+
oxides, above a Mo-saturated monolayer coverage (which is at 10 wt% 
Mo loading), agglomeration of amorphous MoO species results in the 
formation of MoO3 crystals and cause a reduction in the number of 
active sites, as well as the reduction of surface area, by blocking mi-
cropores of the catalyst [135], thus reducing the UAODS. 
Using persulfate agent in toluene and hexane as solvent, 98 wt% 
H2O2 and 1% Si-Al/Al2O3 as solid catalyst, 99.72% of sulfur (followed 
first by extraction with acetone, then by adsorption with activated 
charcoal and ultimately by sonication under 30 kHz US of the diesel 
sample treated with acetic acid) in hydrotreated diesel fuel containing 
766.73 ppmw total S was removed at around 65 ◦C and atmospheric 
pressure [136]. It can be thought that the oxidation mechanism [137] is 
based on sulfate ion radical caused by thermal activation of persulfate, 
hydroxyl radical formed as a result of the reaction of sulphate ion radical 
with H2O2 and activation of S2O8
2− by hydrogen peroxide, which causes 
the formation of hydroxyl radical. Moreover, US can cause homolytic 
cleavage of the persulfate agent [138] and hydrogen peroxide [90]. The 
surface hydroxyl groups [139] on Al2O3 (Fig. 3) in the solid catalyst in 
the reaction medium can induce the formation[137] of SO∙−
4 radical 
from persulfate by interacting with H+ formed by the reaction (4) and, 
hence accelerating the UAODS reaction.

Since homogeneous Fenton catalysts (FeSO4) dissolve in the aqueous 
phase and consequently, making their recovery difficult [140] after ODS 
reactions, water-insoluble Fenton-like catalysts supported on coal fly ash 
(which is a very cheap waste from coal-fired power plants) were syn-
thesized [141]. Approximately 30% desulfurization was carried out as a 
result of simultaneous oxidation and extraction of sulfur compounds 
from commercial diesel fuel containing 595 ppm S using 10 wt% H2O2 
and ethanol solvent in the presence of the Fenton-like catalyst in an 
ultrasonic bath at 47 kHz frequency and 147 W power [65]. It has been 
suggested that the oxidation stems from the hydroxyl radicals formed 
from the reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2. Hydroxyl radicals [90] 
formed from the decomposition of H2O2 by US may also contribute to 
this desulfurization. Furthermore, since coal fly ash contains metal ox-
ides [142], H2O2 helps desulfurization by being adsorbed on the sup-
ported catalyst as well as forming surface-bound hydroxyl radicals on 
the support [143]. 
US has also been applied to oil sands [144] as an oil deposit consisted 
of a mixture of clay, sand, bitumen and water. A total sulfur removal 
efficiency of 82% has been reported by simultaneous oxidative and 
extractive desulfurization of semi-solid Alberta bitumen containing 
5.2 wt% S using 3 wt% H2O2, saturated NaOH and tetrahydrofuran 
under a 28 kHz frequency and 200 W powerful indirect ultrasound at 
20 ◦C and 20 min [145]. Then, an 88% bitumen recovery from oil sand 
and a 42% sulfur reduction from bitumen was fulfilled using the same 
reagents, the same reaction conditions and ultrasonic parameters 
simultaneously. In addition, possible metalloporphyrins [146–148] in 
bitumen can accelerate the UAODS reaction of bitumen. Moreover, it 
was stated that since ionic NaOH cannot dissolve oil sand sufficiently 
and effectively, mid-polar THF is used owing to its high dissolving 
power. 
The UAODS process was not limited to liquid fuels, but also applied 
to mesophase materials [149]. It was demonstrated a sulfur removal 
(followed by extraction with equal volumes of methanol and sodium 
hydroxide (0.5 wt%)) of 91.1% from coal tar pitch with 0.9 wt% S 
containing predominantly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (also 
called polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons) was carried out using xylene 
as dispersant and solvent, trichloroacetic acid as catalyst, 30 wt% H2O2 
in the absence of surfactant under 20 kHz and 300 W direct US at 60 min. 
and 70 ◦C [150]. On the other hand, the use of surfactant did not in-
crease UAODS. 
Apart from hydrogen peroxides, organic peroxide has also been used 
as oxidant. In this type of study [151], approximately 35% desulfur-
ization (followed by extraction three times with acetonitrile) was per-
formed from a high-viscosity bunker-C oil MFO 380 (max kinematic 
viscosity 380 cSt) with 3.17 wt% S using viscosity-reducing heptane and 
3 mL of t-butyl hydroperoxide as oxidant in the presence of 0.2 g MoO3 
as solid catalyst under direct US at a frequency of 20 kHz and 70% 
amplitude at atmospheric pressure, 90 min and 80 ◦C. Unlike HP, TBHP 
has the advantage of being soluble in both aqueous and organic phases, 
therefore, in desulfurization reactions where the aqueous phase is not 
used, it is in direct contact with sulfur compounds without the need for 
mass transfer. It was reported that the much higher-reactivity peroxo 
molybdenum complex formed as a result of the reaction of t-BHP with 
MoO3 is responsible for the oxidation of sulfur compounds to their sul-
fones. When ultrasonic cavitation bubbles in sonochemistry implode, 
very high temperatures and pressures occur locally in the liquid (hot 
spot theory) [152]. Therefore, it can be deduced that reactive oxygen 
species, which are generated by thermal decomposition of t-BHP in this 
reaction, such as t-butoxyl (H3C)3 - O·, hydroxyl HO· and t-butyl peroxyl 
(H3C)3 - O - O· radicals [153], further contributes to the oxidation of 
bunker-C oil. 
2.2. Homogeneous catalysts 
In the presence of heterogeneous catalysts with which sulfur com-
pounds interact electronically on the solid surface, adsorption, where 
mass transfer is an important factor, takes place through catalyst pores 
[154], whereas homogeneous catalysts dissolve in liquid (ie, aqueous 
phase). After UAODS reactions, isolation, recovery and reuse of homo-
geneous liquid catalysts, as well as the homogeneous solid catalysts 
dissolved in the aqueous phase, from the reaction mixture are quite 
problematic since they are in the same phase as reactants, which in-
creases the process cost [155]. 
Reactions, in which homogeneous catalysts are involved, can be 
divided into two classes; 1) Reactions in the absence of PTC 2) Reactions 
in the presence of PTC. Among the homogeneous solid catalysts, cata-
lysts such as phosphotungstic acid [156] as polyoxometallate class, Fe 
(II)SO4 [157] and CuSO4 [158] were employed, while organic acids such 
as acetic acid [159] and formic acid [160] were utilized as homogeneous 
liquid catalysts.

2.2.1. Reactions in the absence of PTC 
In the absence of PTC, the ODS mechanism [161] is shown in Scheme 
2. Peroxyformic acid formed in situ by the reaction of HP and formic 
acid in aqueous phase is transferred to the organic phase where DBT is 
oxidized, by the effect of ultrasound. 
2.2.1.1. The use of acetic acid. In a study [162] where the sonoreactor 
was optimized to increase the UAODS yield, a sulfur removal of 98.25% 
was achieved from model fuel containing 1000 ppmw DBT in n-decane 
using 16 mL of 34.5 wt% H2O2 and 40 mm-diameter sonotrode with an 
immersion depth of 3 cm at acetic acid/H2O2 64: 300 molar ratio in 
7.4 cm-diameter glass reactor under 20 kHz, 500 W and 80% amplitude 
direct US at 48 ◦C within 30 min. 
UAODS of a model fuel containing 100 ppmw DBT (10.8 mM/l) in 
toluene was performed using FeSO4, acetic acid and 30 vol% hydrogen 
peroxide (HP) [163]. It was stated that the hydroperoxyl radicals formed 
were responsible for the oxidation of the sulfur compound rather than 
the hydroxyl radicals formed, hence by explaining that lower scavenging 
of HO2· radicals is important. An DBT removal of approximately 
33.34 wt% from model oil has been reached at acetic acid/HP = 2 vol 
ratio, toluene/HP = 10 vol ratio, at 1.5 M Fe2+ concentration, 90 min 
and atmospheric pressure under 70 W and 35 kHz indirect US at 25 ◦C. 
In a similar study [164] in which desulfurization of benzothiophene 
(BT), 3-methyl thiophene (3-MT) and thiophene (T) was performed 
using 25 mL of 30 vol% HP + CH3COOH and Fe2+, sulfur removals of 
79.4, 77.9, 77% − 76.3, 76.9, 77.6% and 77.5, 76.5, 76.1% were ob-
tained from concentrations of 100, 300 and 500 ppm for BT, 3-MT and T, 
respectively, under 2.5 bar, 35 W and 35 kHz indirect US at 90 min and 
25 ◦C, such that these conversions were higher than those obtained at 
atmospheric pressure due to the elimination of transient cavitations at 
high pressure. In addition, according to the cavitation bubble dynamics 
model, it was revealed that the high desulfurization is caused by the 
sonophysical effect (microconvection) of US. 
In a study [165] in which a sample of raw coal containing 2.16 wt% 
total S as solid fuel was treated with peroxyacetic acid, oxidative 
desulfurization of raw coal improved due to the increased reactivity of 
the coal depending on the increased specific surface area, the total pore 
volume and the mean pore size of the treated coal compared to those of 
the untreated coal since abrasion of coal particles upon sonication oc-
curs; 17.59% of the total sulfur present in the coal was removed using 
10 mL 98 wt% acetic acid and 50 mL 30 wt% HP under 20 kHz and 
720 W direct US at 30 ◦C within 5 min. It was shown that the greatest 
contribution to desulfurization is that US increases the production of 
hydroxyl radical in the presence of HP and acetic acid in the mixture, 
whereas the hydroxyl radical production rate is significantly low when 
there is only HP. 
In a similar study [166] in which the same reactants were used, the 
raw coal was subjected to ultrasonic treatment followed by microwave. 
The US applied reduced the particle size of the coal, increased its total 
porosity (i.e., specific surface area, total pore volume and average pore 
diameter of the raw coal are 0.88 m2.g− 1, 0.00213 cm3.g− 1 and 9.68 nm, 
respectively, whereas specific surface area, total pore volume and 
average pore diameter of the coal sample after US treatment are 1.66 m2. 
g− 1, 0.00771 cm3.g− 1 and 18.56 nm, respectively) and increased hy-
droxyl radicals. But at the same time, microwave increased the reaction 
rate dramatically as the reactants in the mixture absorbed the electro-
magnetic radiation generated [167]. At the end of the ultrasonic treat-
ment at acetic acid (98 wt%)/HP (30 wt%) 1:5 vol ratio under 20 kHz 
and 720 W direct US for 50 min at 40 ◦C, followed by microwave 
treatment under 600 W power at a frequency of 2.45 GHz at 100 ◦C for 
6 min, a desulfurization of nearly 22% was obtained from raw coal 
containing 1.93 wt% organic S, which results from the resonance nature 
of the thiophenic compound according to mercaptan and sulfoether, 
whereas the percentage of pyritic sulfur (in the form of FeS2) removed as 
inorganic sulfur was reported to be about 85%. 
In another study [168] using the same reactants, two coal samples 
(XS with 0.85 wt% organic S and YN with 2.69 wt% organic S) 
completely free of inorganic sulfur as a result of pretreatment with dilute 
nitric acid were subjected simultaneously to ultrasonic and microwave 
Scheme 2. The ODS mechanism with HP-FA system.  
A. Tugrul Albayrak and A. Tavman                                                                                                           
treatment with a power of 560 W each for 50 min. Sulfur removals of 
23.53 and 76.58% were achieved for XS and YN, respectively. Conse-
quently, it turns out that from these three studies concerning coal, 
simultaneous operation (US-MW) is more efficient. 
In desulfurization of model fuels prepared by dissolving model sulfur 
compounds in a non-polar solvent such as octane, heptane or hexane, an 
extraction step is not required since the sulfones as oxidized sulfur 
compounds are easily determined by instrumental devices such as GC- 
FID, HPLC, hence easily finding the conversion to sulfones. However, 
as there are also aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in addition to 
sulfur compounds in real fuels, it is not possible to determine the sulfur 
compounds with these devices. After separating sulfones by an extrac-
tant, the total sulfur percentage in the fuel can be determined by using 
devices such as microcoulometric analyzer, sulfur analyzer with UV 
fluorescence, XRF and GC-SCD. 
Alkaline solutions have also been used in UAODS. In simultaneous 
oxidative and extractive desulfurization [169] of ultra low-sulfur diesel 
spiked with 500 ppmw 4,6-DMDBT, it has been shown that desulfur-
ization in single step can be improved without an extraction step mainly 
due to the hydroxyl radicals formed as well as secondarily the formation 
of carbonate radical CO− ∙
3 by resulting in radical decomposition of HP 
under US in the range of pH 6 ~ 8 with basic sodium carbonate. 
Approximately 94% desulfurization was reported at diesel/acetonitrile 
1: 2 vol ratio, 0.8 M HP 30 wt%, 30 mM Na2CO3 under 23 kHz frequency 
direct ultrasonic pulse at 60 ◦C in 2 h. 
As shown in Table 1, the other studies [170–175] using acetic acid as 
organic acid in addition to HP are common in the literature. In addition, 
acetic acid is relatively low-cost [176]. In studies [97,165,177] in which 
desulfurization of crude oil, coal and model diesel fuel with the help of 
US by using acetic acid-HP oxidant system was performed, it was indi-
cated that high desulfurization efficiency is reached in a short time at 
relatively low temperatures. The oxidation of sulfur compounds is 
caused by peroxyacetic acid and hydroxyl radicals formed in situ in the 
aqueous phase. It has also been shown that nitrogen compounds have an 
inhibitory effect on oxidative desulfurization as the oxidation reactivity 
of the nitrogen compounds present in the fuel (e.g. quinoline) is higher 
than that of the sulfur compounds [172]. Moreover, the effects of 
different US loop reactor types on UAODS were also examined [173]. It 
is stated that the aqueous phase separated after the UAODS reaction and 
the extractant separated after the extraction step can be reused for the 
fresh feedstocks containing 208 ppmw S DBT and the same feedstocks 
subjected to oxidation treatment, respectively, though the desulfuriza-
tion efficiencies in reuses are lower than those in their first uses [171]. 
UAODS efficiencies of diesel fuel feeds containing different sulfur 
amounts in the presence of acetic acid under the relevant reaction 
conditions are shown in Table 1. 
One of the most important reasons why HDS is still widely used today 
is that fuel loss after HDS process is very low [178]. In laboratory-scale 
studies, after the ODS process, the properties of the fuel are almost un-
changed [172,179–186], but the loss of fuel in the extraction step (i.e., 
the reduction of fuel recovery) after the ODS process on large scales can 
pose a major problem. Moreover, whether the properties such as density, 
viscosity, cetane number, boiling range distribution of the desulfurized 
fuel produced in large quantities (factory scale) have changed is a matter 
of investigation separately and must be checked one by one. In most 
research papers [171,187–189], when H2O2/S mole ratio initially in-
creases, desulfurization generally increases, then reaches a certain value 
and decreases slowly after this optimum value. It was reported that this 
decline is due to dilution of the aqueous phase. 
In a study [172] in which nitrogen was removed by US from a syn-
thetic fuel solution with 252 ppmw N prepared by dissolving quinoline 
in a hydrotreated petroleum product feed containing 3.6 ppm S, 92% 
nitrogen removal (followed by extraction with methanol) was achieved 
in the case where only acetic acid is used in the absence of HP as oxidant. 
It is stated that this value is higher than the value (79% nitrogen 
removal) obtained without oxidation treatment by only liquid–liquid 
extraction with methanol, hence underlining that acetic acid has the 
capacity to extract nitrogen compounds. 
The effects of different sonoreactor types on desulfurization and 
denitrogenation (followed by silica gel adsorption) of hydrotreated 
diesel fuel containing 241 ppmw S and 161 ppmw N were also evaluated 
[173]. It was shown that the most effective reactor in terms of cost and 
performance optimization was sonitube. 
In an oxidation study [190] accomplished under 20 kHz and 70 W 
direct US followed by extraction with DMF, it was stated that while the 
initial sulfur content in the model fuel containing DBT increased from 
1220.80 ppmw to 3976.86 ppmw, desulfurization also increased to 
98.35%. In the UAODS [175] followed by extraction, as acetic acid/oil 
ratio increased to 1.50 wt%, the desulfurization of diesel containing 849 
ppmw S improved. This was attributed to the strong oxidant peracetic 
acid formed in situ. 
Heterogeneous reactions with solid–liquid systems using solid oxi-
dants were also carried out. HP-acetic acid at S/oxidant 1:10 molar 
ratio, KO2-Acetic acid, Na2S2O8 alone, Na2S2O8-acetic acid and oxone 
alone at S/oxidant 1:10 and 1:30 molar ratios at different times at 80 ◦C 
were used [186] for UAODS of model oils and diesel fuel. Sulfur and 
nitrogen removal were individually performed by ultrasonic horn device 
under 21.1 kHz and 80 W direct US and ultrasonic cup horn device under 
19.9 kHz and 80 W US from mild hydrotreated diesel feedstock con-
taining 226 ± 2.17 ppmw total S and 158 ± 2.81 ppmw total N as well as 
three model solutions containing 1.2 mg mL− 1 DBT or DMDBT and 
1.2 mg mL− 1 quinoline individually. In UAODS reactions of model so-
lutions in both reactor types, when oxone alone is used at a molar ratio 
of S/oxidant = 1:30 without acetic acid, very high desulfurization effi-
ciencies compared to other oxidant systems (100% sulfur removal for 
DBT and DMDBT in 90 min, a nitrogen removal of 40% for quinoline in 
the same time) were achieved. For scale-up purposes, the US cup horn 
was chosen as it closely resembles the geometry of continuous flow re-
actors and sulfur was removed (followed by SiO2 adsorption) from 
hydrotreated diesel fuel at molar ratios of (S +N)/oxidant 1:10, 1:20 
and 1:30 by oxone at different times. In addition to obtaining a diesel 
fuel containing 0.91 ± 0.48 ppmw N (a nitrogen removal of 99.4%) at a 
molar ratio of 1:30 in 90 min, a sulfur removal of 99% was achieved. In 
the case of extraction with MeOH instead of adsorption, significantly 
low desulfurization (65%) was obtained for the same molar ratio and the 
same time, but diesel fuel recovery with SiO2 adsorption was lower than 
that with methanol extraction by 11%. It was stated that excess oxone 
can be reused for the same diesel fuel without losing its activity in four 
treatment cycles followed by adsorption with SiO2 each (from 84% 
sulfur removal at the end of the 1st cycle up to 95% at the end of the 4th 
cycle). Although oxone is a relatively inexpensive oxidant and provides 
high desulfurization, a 15% diesel loss after adsorption with SiO2 makes 
it very difficult to use in large scales, on the contrary, low desulfuriza-
tion efficiencies were obtained by extraction with methanol due to low 
extractive performance of the extractant selected for oxidized sulfur 
compounds. This major difference between extraction and adsorption 
performance could possibly be due to SiO2 adsorbing not only oxidized 
sulfur compounds but also sulfur compounds [191]. 
After biphasic UAODS reactions in the presence of HP and acetic 
acid, how to valorize the aqueous phase or eliminate the sulfur com-
pounds and their oxidized counterparts in the aqueous phase is a crucial 
environmental issue. 
A 96.45% sulfur removal [192] (followed by extraction with aceto-
nitrile at 1000 rpm mechanical stirring speed for 25 min at room tem-
perature) was achieved from model diesel fuel containing 3976.861 mg 
S L–1, which is prepared by dissolving DBT in homogeneous solution (n- 
dodecane + n-heptane + n-hexadecane), using 10 mL HP and 10 mL 
acetic acid under 20 kHz frequency, 70 W power and 80% amplitude 
direct US at 70 ◦C in 30 min. The aqueous phase (total organic carbon 
TOC content 1200 mg L–1) containing DBT, DBTO2 and acetic acid, that 
is separated after the heterogeneous UAODS reaction and called diesel 
wastewater, was diluted individually 10- and 20-fold with distilled 
water and subsequently subjected to homogeneous ODS reaction at C 
(Fe2+) = 2 mmol L–1 and C(HP) = 20 mmol L–1 Fenton’s reagent con-
centration (with acetic acid by adjusting pH to 3.1) under 200 W and 
20 kHz direct US for 120 min. At the end of the homogeneous ODS re-
actions of the two aqueous phase samples diluted 10- and 20-fold with 
pure water, a removal of 75 and 76% for DBTO2, 28 and 66% for TOC, 
respectively, were obtained. HPLC analysis of the treated diesel waste-
water confirmed the formation of benzoic acid followed by aliphatic 
carboxylic acids (e.g., oxalic acid) after 30 min as a result of oxidative 
degradation of small amounts of remaining DBT. It was stated that this 
sono-Fenton process has the potential to remove organic pollutants from 
diesel waste water and the treated water can be reused. 
In order to further remove the sulfur in the fuel (i.e., to obtain ultra- 
low or low-sulfur fuel), advanced oxidation processes, which are used in 
the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater, have also been 
utilized in UAODS reactions. For this purpose, FeSO4 was added to the 
aqueous phase containing HP-acetic acid and a 98.32% desulfurization 
degree [193] (followed by extraction two times at DMF/oil 1:1 vol ratio 
for 2 min each at room temperature) of hydrotreated Middle Eastern 
diesel fuel containing 568.75 ppmw total S was obtained at optimum 
conditions (40 ◦C, Fe2+/HP 0.05 mol/mol, pH = 2.10 and reaction time 
of 15 min) under 200 W and 28 kHz direct US. Explaining that the high 
desulfurization is due to the Fe2+ ion which generates more hydroxyl 
radicals from HP, it has been determined that the US-Fenton’s reagent 
system follows the second order reaction kinetics. 
In a similar study [184] where Fenton’s reagent as oxidizer and 
acetic acid were used, 97.5% sulfur removal from original diesel fuel 
containing 1936.48 ppmw total S (followed by extraction at DMF/oil 
1:1 vol ratio under vigorous mixing at room temperature) has been 
achieved at optimum operating conditions (70 ◦C, 10 min, 8 W cm− 2 
ultrasonic intensity, O/S molar ratio 6: 1, FeSO4/HP mass ratio 2:10 and 
acetic acid/HP volume ratio 1:2) under direct US at 28 kHz frequency. It 
was reported that the diesel loss after oxidation-extraction is less than 
8 wt% and although the density and cetane index decreased a little, the 
other properties of diesel fuel did not change much. 
By virtue of very severe process conditions (Hydrotreated diesel fuel 
with 421.45 ppmw total S obtained as the feeding material by hydro-
treatment of diesel fuel containing 9997 ppmw total S for two-stage 
HDS, 7 MPa, 628 K, LHSV 1.8 h− 1) necessary to reduce very high- 
sulfur diesel fuels by HDS to less than 10 ppmw S (9.5 ppmw S), 
diesel fuel containing 9997 ppmw total S was first processed by HDS in 
milder conditions (with 99.8% diesel fuel recovery) to obtain a fuel 
containing 421.45 ppmw S and then subjected to oxidation reaction 
(followed by extractions two times at DMF/oil 1: 1 vol ratio for 2 min 
each at room temperature) at 70 ◦C, HP/Diesel Oil 3/100 vol ratio, 
pH = 2.1 and Fe2+/HP 0.05 mol g− 1 in the presence of Fenton’s reagent 
and acetic acid under 28 kHz and 200 W direct US in 15 min [178]. 
Along with the 92.2% diesel fuel recovery, diesel fuel containing 9 
ppmw total S (97.86% sulfur removal) was obtained. Therefore, it was 
stated that integrating the ODS unit as a complement to the HDS unit is 
potentially advantageous in terms of overall process cost and efficiency. 
It was reported that by using individually Fenton’s Reagent and 
Fenton-type reagent (Cu2+-HP), which is used to enrich hydroxyl radi-
cals, in the presence of acetic acid (pH = 1.9 ~ 2.1), a desulfurization 
degree (followed by extraction twice at DMF/fuel 1:1 vol ratio at room 
temperature for 10 min each) of 95.2 and 89.2%, respectively, was 
achieved for FCC diesel fuel [185] with 1936.48 ppmw total S at 60 ◦C, 
HP/S 6:1 molar ratio and M2+ (Fe2+ or Cu2+)/HP 0.05 mol mol− 1 under 
28 kHz and 200 W direct US in 15 min, which is an indication that metal 
ions catalyze the UAODS reaction creating a synergistic effect. 
2.2.1.2. The use of formic acid. In a study [179] conducted to remove 
sulfur from a straight run diesel oil sample containing 960 ppm S (fol-
lowed by extraction one time with DMF at extractant/oil volume ratio of 
1:2), a desulfurization yield of 94.7% was obtained at the optimum 
conditions (HP/formic acid (FA) 1: 1 vol ratio, (HP + FA)/oil 1:10 vol 
ratio, 50 ◦C and 10 min) under 28 kHz–40 kHz and max 200 W direct US. 
It was observed that the degree of desulfurization almost does not in-
crease due to the decomposition of HP after the optimum reaction time, 
the sulfur removal is slightly reduced due to side reactions after the 
optimum oxidant/oil volume ratio, and the desulfurization removal 
does not change beyond the optimum temperature. Moreover, it was 
stated that beyond optimum conditions, oil recovery decreases and also 
production costs will increase. 
In a similar study [180] under the same optimum conditions as the 
previous study [179] (except that extractant DMF/oil volume ratio is 1: 
1 and extraction time is twice), the effect of HP/FA volume ratio under 
direct US was investigated and a sulfur removal of 92.8% has been ob-
tained from FCC diesel oil containing 1948 ppmw total S at the end of 
the UAODS process. Beyond the optimum oxidant/catalyst volume ratio 
(1:1), it was reported that desulfurization decreases due to nonproduc-
tive decomposition of excess HP to oxygen and water as there is not 
enough formic acid in the medium to form high-concentration perox-
yformic acid in-situ by reaction of HP with FA. 
The effect of extraction on desulfurization after the oxidation reac-
tion of sulfur compounds in FCC diesel containing 1985 ppm total S with 
HP-FA oxidant system under indirect US was investigated [194]. Taking 
into account oil recovery and the consumption of extraction solvent, a 
desulfurization of 94.2% was achieved as a result of extraction two times 
at DMF/oil volume ratio of 1:1 at 30 ◦C for 20 min each. 
Recently, RSM-Box-Behnken Design has been used to find the opti-
mum desulfurization, to examine the effect of reaction parameters and 
interactions between the parameters on UAODS yield and also to find 
which parameter or parametric relationships are more important on 
desulfurization such that fewer experiments are performed with this 
program, thus resulting in less time-consuming study. 
Using RSM [181], a sulfur removal of 95.46% from kerosene con-
taining 2490 ppmw total S was achieved at the ratio of nO/nS = 15.02, 
nacid/nS = 107.8 and US power/fuel volume = 7.6 W mL− 1 (followed by 
extraction with acetonitrile, extractant/kerosene volume ratio = 1, 
extraction stage = 1, ambient temperature, 700 rpm, 30 min.) at 20 kHz 
frequency and 400 W direct US at 50 ◦C within 10.5 min. It was observed 
that above the optimum nacid/nS and nO/nS ratios, the desulfurization 
was almost unchanged as performic acid formation and decomposition 
reactions occur together in an acidic medium and the equilibrium con-
centration of peroxyformic acid was reached due to the decomposition 
of HP. When the two ratios in the relation of power/volume and nO/nS to 
sulfur removal are above a certain value, no increase in desulfurization 
was observed due to dilution in the aqueous phase and the weakening of 
the ultrasonic wave emitted to the mixture by enlargement of the bubble 
cloud at the probe tip at high power. The fact that there is no significant 
increase in desulfurization above a certain value of the two ratios in the 
relation between power/volume and nacid/nS is due to the reason 
mentioned above. While a sulfur removal of 29.92% from kerosene is 
achieved by extraction alone employing acetonitrile without oxidation 
reaction, the desulfurization is 74.9% by oxidation and water washing 
without extraction process, which shows that formic acid extracts 
oxidized sulfur compounds sulfoxides and sulfones during the oxidation 
reaction. 
In a similar study [195] with the same oxidant system by applying 
RSM, a sulfur removal higher than 98% was achieved at HP/S molar 
ratio of 10.82, FA/S molar ratio of 379.75 and 52 ◦C (which are the three 
independent reaction parameters selected) under 70 W and 20 kHz 
direct US and at 15 min for model fuel containing 500 ppm total S pre-
pared by dissolving BT in toluene. With the same values of these 3 op-
timum parameters found, a sulfur reduction of approximately 95.6% 
(followed by extraction at acetonitrile/kerosene volume ratio of 1 for 
30 min at room temperature) was achieved from kerosene containing 
2720 ppmw total S under 250 W direct US in 20 min. The results 
revealed that the decrease in desulfurization at low acid/S and high O/S 
values is due to the dilution of the formic acid by increased surplus HP, 
thus lowering peroxyformic acid concentration and also the formation of 
vapor-filled bubbles rather than gas-filled bubbles with increasing HP. It 
was found that the importance degree of the independent reaction pa-
rameters was in descending order: Acid/S molar ratio >HP/S molar 
ratio> (Acid/S molar ratio)2 according to the ANOVA results of the 
quadratic correlation equation (where the smaller than 0.05 the P value 
and the larger the F value, the more important the parameter). 
In a study [196] with the same oxidant system, using the RSM-Box- 
Behnken Design (BBD), where temperature and US power/gas fuel 
volume (W mL− 1) were selected as constant parameters and O/S, Acid/O 
molar ratios and sonication time as process variables, 87% sulfur 
removal from gas oil containing 2210 ppmw total S (followed by one- 
time extraction at acetonitrile/gas oil volume ratio of 1: 1 under 
vigorous stirring for 30 min at room temperature) was achieved at O/S 
46.36 molar ratio, acid/O 3.22 molar ratio in 19.81 min for 50 ◦C and 
7.78 W mL− 1 under a direct US of 20 kHz. However, in the case of 4-step 
extraction, 96.2% of the sulfur present in the gas oil was removed, but it 
was reported that the recovery of gas oil decreased to 81.25%. After the 
oxidation reaction under the same conditions, the extraction perfor-
mances under mechanical mixing and under direct US were compared. It 
was observed that the desulfurization yields were approximately the 
same, thus showing that US does not have a positive effect on extraction. 
In addition to these, as a result of the preliminary cost analysis of this 
batch process, it was determined that a total operating cost of $ 0.43 was 
incurred for the treatment of 1 L gas fuel and also 31.7 and 56.3% of this 
total cost were liquid–liquid extraction and US Power/gas oil volume, 
respectively. It was stated that this calculated cost will be less in 
continuous-flow UAODS systems as there are stagnant zones in the 
mixture in batch UAODS systems, thus leading to a higher consumption 
of US power density per unit volume of fuel in the batch systems. Ac-
cording to ANOVA analysis, it was determined that the importance of 
variables is in the order: sonication time > acid/O molar ratio >O/S 
molar ratio> (acid/O × sonication time)> (sonication time)2> (acid/O 
molar ratio)2> (O/S molar ratio) × (acid/O molar ratio)> (O/S molar 
ratio)2. It was explained that sulfur removal decreased due to the 
scavenge of hydroxyl radicals at high acid/O molar ratio and enhance-
ment of side reactions in case there is excess HP in the medium towards 
high O/S molar ratio. In high acid/O and high O/S molar ratios, it was 
explained that peroxyformic acid stabilizes at low pH of the aqueous 
phase as a result of very high concentration of formic acid after a certain 
value, thus resulting in a lower desulfurization by limiting the produc-
tion of active oxidizing radicals, which are generated by the decompo-
sition of performic acid. 
The RSM-BBD was applied to a batch reactor in a continuous study 
[188] in which the aqueous phase consisting of HP and FA is injected by 
nozzles of different diameter to just below the bottom end of the probe 
(which is the active site where radicals are produced). O/S molar ratio, 
acid/S molar ratio and sonication time were selected as independent 
variables at 50 ◦C under 20 kHz and 360 W direct US and the optimum 
parameters (nO/nS = 38.88, nacid/nS = 116.47 and sonication time 
29.2 min.) were determined under batch conditions. According to 
ANOVA, it is stated that the most important terms are in the order: acid/ 
S molar ratio> (O/S molar ratio × acid/S molar ratio) > sonication time. 
These optimum parameters have been applied to two continuous re-
actors in series (where in the first reactor, the aqueous phase was 
injected to the lower end of the probe) at different feed rates (thus 
causing different retention times) and different fuel phase/aqueous 
phase volume ratios (herein (Vacid/VO) = 1.117). For non-hydrogenated 
diesel fuel containing 1550 ppmw total S, a desulfurization of 83.39% 
(followed by a single extraction with acetonitrile/organic phase volume 
ratio of 1:1 at 1000 rpm mixing speed for 30 min at room temperature) 
was reached at Vf (volume of the fuel phase)/Vaq (volume of the aqueous 
phase) 5: 1 vol ratio, 40 mL min− 1 total outlet flow rate (33.33 mL min− 1 
diesel fuel + 6.67 mL min− 1 aqueous phase), a residence time of 3 min in 
the first reactor and 2.5 min in the second reactor using 1.5-mm-diam-
eter nozzle from the point of the lowest retention time and lowest 
aqueous phase volume to minimize the process cost. It was explained 
that when the nozzle diameter decreases from 1.5 mm to 0.43 mm, the 
desulfurization decreased to 68.74% due to a decline in the ratio of the 
hydrodynamic momentum flow rate generated by the US probe to the 
hydrodynamic momentum flow rate of the dispersed aqueous phase (in 
which case, aqueous phase will stay in the active zone for much less time 
as the increasing flow rate by use of the smaller nozzle diameter leads to 
the increased momentum). In addition, it was shown that the increase of 
the aqueous phase flow rate from 10 to 40 mL min− 1 for all the nozzle 
diameters leads to a decrease in desulfurization due to the reason 
mentioned above. Batch sonoreactor and sonoreactors in series oper-
ating at different times at a constant volume ratio of Vf/ 
Vaq = 2.96 mL mL− 1 and at different Vf/Vaq ratios at constant sonication 
times of 5.5 min were compared and it was reported that in all cases, the 
sulfur removal per power density consumed in continuous sonoreactors 
in series is higher than that in the batch sonoreactor. 
The effect of pressure on UAODS in a sonoreactor was investigated 
[197] and the optimum conditions (390 W US power at 20 kHz fre-
quency, gauge pressure 0.03 barg and 22 min) were found by applying 
RSM-BBD in which pressure, US Power and sonication time were 
selected as independent variables at T = 50 ◦C, nO/nS = 15.02 and 
nacid/nS = 107.8. A sulfur removal of 96.7% (followed by one-time 
extraction at acetonitrile/kerosene 1:1 vol ratio under 500 rpm stirring 
speed for 30 min at room temperature) was obtained from kerosene with 
2490 ppmw total S. Also, it was disclosed that according to 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD), desulfurization decreased at 
pressures above atmospheric pressure (1 barg and 2 barg) due to the 
progressively decreasing vapor volume fraction, the decreasing bubble 
collapse pressure, the low dispersion of the aqueous phase into the 
organic phase and a significant increase in the aqueous phase volume 
fraction. The authors suggested that the marked rise in the aqueous 
phase volume fraction did not result in finer emulsion droplets, thus 
causing the interfacial area between the aqueous and organic phase to 
diminish. In addition, it was stated that when the US Power increased 
from 100 to 400 W, the max acoustic pressure and micro-streaming 
speed increased according to the calorimetric analysis, thus desulfur-
ization was improved due to the increase in mass transfer rate. It was 
determined that the most important terms affecting desulfurization are 
in the order: time > Pressure > Pressure × Power > Power according to 
ANOVA. 
In a continuous cylindrical sonoreactor with multiple probes (3 
probes) and two nozzles [182], through which the aqueous phase is 
injected just below the first and the second probe tips from the left side 
of the inside of the reactor, the optimum conditions (Vacid/VO (mL mL− 1) 
1.12, Vaq = (Vacid +VO) 733.33 mL, Vf = 3666.67 mL, Vf/Vaq (mL mL− 1) 
5 and temperature 50 ◦C) were determined under direct ultrasound, 
each of which has a power of 400 W and a frequency of 20 kHz (all ul-
trasonic processors ON). >97% of sulfur (followed by extraction with 
DMF) from diesel fuel containing 1550 ppmw total S was removed using 
two 1.5-mm-diameter nozzles at 15 min residence time, 277.2 W elec-
trical power, 48.90 mL min− 1 total aqueous phase volumetric flow rate 
(flow rate of each nozzle 24.45 mL min− 1) and fuel phase volumetric 
flow rate of 244.44 mL min− 1. According to the CFD simulation results, 
it was explained that this high desulfurization is due to the higher hy-
drodynamic momentum ratio (momentum of ultrasonic jet-like 
streaming/momentum of the aqueous phase injected by the nozzle) as 
well as secondarily, further oxidation reactions of DBT derivatives with 
oxidizing radicals (HO2⋅, O⋅ and HO⋅) in the active zone just below the 
probe tips not only when larger-diameter (1.5 mm) nozzles are used 
instead of 0.4- and 0.9-mm-diameter nozzles but also when each of the 
aqueous phase flow rates is lower (using two nozzles with an aqueous 
phase flow rate of 24.45 mL min− 1 each instead of using a single nozzle 
with the aqueous phase flow rate of 48.89 mL min− 1). In this case, it was 
suggested that the aqueous phase is dispersed more homogeneously into 
fuel when compared to smaller diameter nozzles at higher flow rates. 
The operating cost of the UAOD system was investigated [183] in a 
continuous flow jacketed glass reactor where the glass nozzle through 
which the aqueous phase (85 wt% FA + 35 wt% HP) flows is placed 3 cm 
below the US probe tip. Residence time (min), FA/S molar ratio and 
oxidant/S molar ratio were selected as independent variables at a re-
action temperature of 50 ◦C as constant value and RSM based on BBD 
was applied. A sulfur removal of 86.90% (followed by one-time 
extraction at DMF:oil 1:1 vol ratio at room temperature and 875 rpm 
stirring speed for 30 min) was obtained from the partially hydrotreated 
diesel fuel containing 2760 ppmw total S at optimum conditions 
(retention time of 16 min, molar ratio of na/nS 54.47 and molar ratio of 
nO/nS 8.24) under 360 W and 20 kHz direct US. Under these optimum 
conditions, it was reported that the organic phase/aqueous phase vol-
ume ratio is 4.34 and the operating cost (chemical consump-
tion + electricity due to ultrasound irradiation) is 7.73 cents per liter of 
oxidized diesel fuel. As the largest part of the operating cost was HP 
consumption, the organic phase/aqueous phase volume ratio was 
increased to 10 in order to significantly reduce the aqueous phase con-
sumption at residence time 16 min and FA/HP volume ratio 3.16. 
Eventually, a sulfur removal of 84.38% was achieved with an operating 
cost of 4.66 cents per liter of oxidized diesel fuel at na/nS 23.64 molar 
ratio, nO/nS 3.58 molar ratio, 7.07 mL min− 1 diesel flow rate and 
0.71 mL min− 1 aqueous phase flow rate (0.54 mL min− 1 85 wt% 
FA + 0.17 mL min− 1 35 wt% HP). According to ANOVA results, it was 
determined that the most important terms affecting desulfurization in 
this process are in the order: residence time ≈ na/nS > (residence 
time)2 > (na/nS)2 > (na/nS × nO/nS) > (nO/nS)2. 
Sono-desulfurization of gasoline and crude oil was performed at 
optimum conditions found by applying RSM-BBD in which ultrasonic 
power, irradiation time and oxidant amount are selected as independent 
variables [198]. A desulfurization of 80.87% (followed by extraction 
three times at DMSO/gasoline 1:1 vol ratio and water washing four 
times) was obtained for gasoline containing 1207 ppmw S at optimum 
conditions (464.7 W direct ultrasonic power (pulsed ultrasound 2 s on, 
2 s off), 5.5 min irradiation time and 8.1 mL HP (HP: FA volume ratio 
1:1)), whereas a sulfur removal of 73.37% (followed by first magnetic 
stirring of oil sample for one h and then extraction with 60 mL of a 
mixture at acetonitrile:methanol:water 1:1:1 vol ratio) was achieved 
from the crude oil containing 28,620 ppmw S at optimum conditions 
(785.1 W direct ultrasonic power, 6.2 min irradiation time, 11.4 mL HP 
(HP: FA, the same volume ratio) with the same pulsed ultrasound. It was 
stated that after the oxidation of the gasoline sample, adding distilled 
water up to 1% of the DMSO volume to DMSO for the extraction of 
oxidized sulfur compounds decreases desulfurization by 20% compared 
to extraction alone with DMSO. It was explained that this low desul-
furization is due to the fact that water reduces the extraction ability of 
DMSO as the DMSO and water dipole moments [199] are 3.96 and 1.85 
D, respectively, (hence DMSO has greater polarity). The differences 
between mechanical stirring-heating and desulfurization under US were 
compared and these differences were reported to be approximately 10 
and 30% for gasoline and heavy crude oil, respectively, which demon-
strates that UAODS is more effective for high-sulfur fuels. This threefold 
higher difference can be attributed to the emergence of the higher 
cavitation intensity [200] as heavy crude oil has higher density, higher 
viscosity and higher surface tension than gasoline. In addition, the high 
vapor pressure of extremely volatile gasoline compared to heavy crude 
oil can limit violent implosion of cavitation bubbles in the liquid mixture 
[125]. 
RSM-Box-Behnken Design (BBD) was used to evaluate the effects of 
nformic acid/nS, nO/nS, ultrasound power (UP)/simulated oil volume and 
temperature on UAODS and to optimize these reaction parameters on 
the purpose of max attainable desulfurization efficiency [187]. A sulfur 
removal of approximately 97% from DBT containing 500 ppmw S in 
toluene is reported at nO/nS = 26.7, nformic acid/nS = 74.6, UP/model oil 
volume = 7 W cm− 3 and at 50 ◦C under 20 kHz and 400 W direct US in 
630 s. Besides, it was stated that the FA (formic acid)/HP molar ratio 
should be at a certain value (1.4–2.8) in order to maximize the con-
centration of peroxyformic acid (HCOOOH), which is formed in the 
equilibrium reaction between HP and HCOOH in the aqueous phase in 
desulfurization reactions and oxidizes the sulfur compounds. 
In a study [161] where a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model 
was used to examine the hydrodynamic and mass transfer characteristics 
of model fuel in the ultrasonic horn reactor, it was explained that high 
desulfurization is caused by physical effects such as jet stream, high 
turbulence intensity rather than the chemical effect of ultrasound, and 
the reaction is controlled by chemical kinetic due to the very high mass 
transfer rate. In the mentioned study, a sulfur removal of 96.35% from 
the model fuel containing 500 ppmw DBT in toluene was achieved at nO/ 
nS = 26.7, nformic acid/nS = 74.6, UP/Model Oil Volume = 26.7 W mL− 1 
under 20 kHz direct US at 50 ◦C in 210 s. 
It was observed in the studies [178,181–185] that the properties of 
diesel fuels (density at 15 ◦C, kinematic viscosity at 40 ◦C, flash point, 
water content, cetane index) almost did not change after UAODS process 
followed by extraction. 
Three organic acid catalysts (FA, acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid) 
were compared and a 76.5% sulfur reduction [201] (followed by 
extraction at a DMF/oil volume ratio of 1:1) was achieved for the cat-
alytic cracking diesel containing 1452 ppmw total S by using trifluoro-
acetic acid at oxidant/oil 1:10 vol ratio, 70 ◦C and 60 min as the 
optimum operating conditions under indirect 20 kHz US, which is higher 
than the sulfur removals obtained in the case of using acetic acid and FA 
catalysts as the acidity [202] of trifluoroacetic acid (pKa = 0.18) is 
higher than that of formic acid (pKa = 3.75) and acetic acid (pKa = 4.75), 
thus causing the oxidizing power of the peroxycarboxylic acid formed to 
increase further. 
In a study [189] where 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium hydrogen 
sulfate [Bmim][HSO4] and 1-octyl-3-methyl imidazolium hydrogen 
sulphate [Omim][HSO4] with two different alkyl lengths were synthe-
sized and used instead of aqueous phase, approximately 100% desul-
furization yield of the model fuel containing 500 ppmw DBT in n-decane 
was obtained using [Omim][HSO4] at O/S = 5 molar ratio and mass 
ratio IL/model fuel = 2 under 30 W power and 25 kHz direct US at 25 ◦C 
in 3 min. In the experiments in the absence of ultrasound, it was 
explained that the desulfurization with [Omim][HSO4] is higher than 
the desulfurization with [Bmim][HSO4] by applying the same optimum 
operating conditions as the case of using ultrasound under stirring at 
900 rpm. It was noted this high desulfurization is due to the longer alkyl 
chain of the cation of [Omim][HSO4]. In addition, the reactivity of 
different sulfur compounds under the same operating conditions was 
compared and it was reported that the UAODS was in descending order 
DBT > BT > T > 4,6-DMDBT. It was stated that the lowest desulfuriza-
tion for 4,6-DMDBT is due to the steric hindrance of two alkyl groups 
adjacent to the sulfur atom, hence weakening the π-π interaction be-
tween the aromatic sulfur compound and the ionic liquid. Under the 
same optimum conditions, a UAODS efficiency of 76.3% was obtained 
for the real diesel fuel containing 746 ppmw total S. Moreover, it was 
reported that [Omim][HSO4] can be used six times without losing its 
activity in UAODS reactions of the model fuel by regenerating it after 
each reaction and the solubility of the model fuel in this ionic liquid is 
very low (1.45 wt%), thus suggesting that the synthesized ionic liquid 
has the potential to be used both as an extractant and as a catalyst. 
However, the high viscosity of ionic liquids, their costly synthesis 
[203], and the change in the solubility [204] of the fuel in the ionic 
liquid according to the anions and cations formed depending on the 
starting raw materials, and more importantly, the presence of aromatic 
groups [177,189] such as imidazolium in IL significantly that reduces 
the desulfurization reactivity of thiophenes, especially abundant in pe-
troleum products, due to steric hindrance make the UAODS process very 
difficult to be feasible using ionic liquid. 
One of the two identical hydrotreated diesel feeds containing 231 
ppmw S and 115.5 ppmw N to use expensive oxidants in lower quantities 
was subjected to pre-extractive desulfurization and the other to pre- 
adsorptive desulfurization (diesel/methanol volume ratio 1:1 for EDS/ 
N and diesel/fuller’s earth (V/W) = 1:0.2 for ADS/N) and then, the 
UAODS/UAODN reaction (followed by EDS/N and ADS/N individually 
at the same ratios as those in the pre-treatments) of the two partially 
desulfurized and denitrogenized fuel samples (S = 196 ppmw and 
N = 85 ppmw after pre-EDS/N and S = 184 ppmw and N = 52 ppmw 
after pre-ADS/N) was performed using oxone or HP in US Cup Horn at 
80 ◦C under 80 W and 19.9 kHz direct US for 90 min [205]. As a result of 
all these processes, diesel fuel with 11 ppmw S and 6 ppmw N is obtained 
by the pre- and post-ADS/N process, while diesel fuel with 78 ppmw S 
and 25 ppmw N is obtained by the pre- and post-EDS/N process, thus 
suggesting that it would be economically feasible to use cheap and 
efficient adsorbent fuller’s earth instead of expensive extractant meth-
anol. It was stated that this process can be proposed to be complemen-
tary to HDS. 
2.2.2. UAODS reactions in the presence of PTC 
According to the ODS mechanism [28,29,206] (Scheme 3) using 
phosphotungstic acid in the presence of PTC, the phosphotungstate 
anion in aqueous phase is oxidized to the peroxophosphotungstate anion 
(1) by HP, then this active oxidizing complex anion is transferred (3) to 
organic phase by forming an ion pair (2) with the lipophilic cation of 
PTC. This complex anion is reduced to phosphotungstate anion by 
oxidizing the sulfur compounds in organic phase (4). The phospho-
tungstate anion is transferred to the aqueous phase by the lipophilic 
cation (5) and the cycle is completed. 
A DBT removal of 100% from model fuel [206] containing 4000 
ppmw S DBT in toluene was performed using HP 30 vol% (phospho-
tungstic acid concentration of 0.6 mM in aqueous phase and tetraocty-
lammonium bromide (TOAB) concentration of 7.32 mM in organic 
phase) under 600 W and 20 kHz direct US at 75 ◦C in 7 min. The same 
conditions were applied to diesel fuels with different sulfur content at 
certain times (18 min for diesel A with 7744 ppmw S, 10 min for diesel B 
with 3011 ppmw S and 10 min for diesel C with 1867 ppmw S) at 75 ◦C 
and a desulfurization yield (followed by extraction with acetonitrile 
three times at solvent/oil mass ratio of 1:2 at room temperature for 
2 min each) of 98.2, 98.7 and 99.4%, respectively, was achieved along 
with a fuel recovery of 82.8, 87.2 and 85.5 wt%. It was reported n- 
paraffins, n-alkyl cyclohexanes, n-alkyl benzenes and alkyl naphthalenes 
as component classes in the diesel C sample selected as representative 
were not adversely affected during oxidation, but alkyl naphthalenes 
among the four main components have relatively high polarity and thus 
they were extracted by acetonitrile. 
In a similar study [207] (where the temperature, tetraoctyl

ammonium fluoride (TOAF) concentration, sonication time, phospho-
tungstic acid concentration and HP purity were 70 ◦C, 7.5 mM, 10 min, 
0.7 mM and 30 vol%, respectively) with the research [206], under the 
same direct US power and frequency in a continuous flow sonoreactor, 
marine fuel with less than 23 ppmw S and jet fuel with 1 ppmw S (each 
followed by adsorption with activated, acidic Al2O3), respectively, were 
obtained from marine gas oil containing 1710 ppmw S and Jet Fuel (JP- 
8) containing 863 ppmw S. 33-fold lower consumption of Al2O3 
compared to acetonitrile, loss of alkyl naphthalene less than 1 wt%, 
regeneration with 94% alumina recovery by washing with DMF solvent 
and maintaining 99% of its adsorption capacity by calcination at 550 ◦C 
have revealed that alumina has the potential of being used in large-scale 
continuous systems. 
In another study [208] where 30 wt% HP and phosphotungstic acid 
were used, the UAODS performances of DBT in the presence of different 
phase transfer catalyst types at 70 ◦C under 20 kHz and 600 W direct US 
were evaluated. It was stated that desulfurization reactions of DBT took 
place in the presence of TOAB (49.57% conversion), tetrabutylammo-
nium bromide (TBAB) (38.34% conversion), methyltributylammonium 
chloride (MBAC) (11.4%), methyltributylammonium hydroxide 
(MBAH) (11.10%) and tetramethylammonium fluoride (8.20%) as 
cationic-type PTCs, whereas desulfurization reactions did not occur in 
the presence of 1-octanesulfonic acid as anionic-type PTC, Tween 80 as 
non-ionic PTC and in the absence of PTC. In addition, in the presence of 
TOAF and tetraoctadecylammonium bromide (TODAB), 90.30% 
(97.53% in 20 min for TOAF) and 56.89% conversions were performed 
in 10 min, respectively. From these results, it was emphasized that the 
biggest positive effect on UAODS is the long alkyl chain (hence more 
lipophilic cation) bound to the quaternary cation, and the less positive 
effect is the hydrophilic anion of quaternary salt. It was stated that the 
smaller (i.e., the more hydrophilic) the size of the monoatomic anion of 
quaternary salt for the same alkyl chain length, the more effective the 
PTC. It was determined by GC-PFPD analysis that 3-bromobenzothio-
phene and 2-bromobenzothiophene sulfone were formed as in-
termediates when TOAB was used in UAODS reactions of BT, while in 
the case of TOAF, intermediate products were not formed. The forma-
tion of the byproducts can be shown representatively in Scheme 4: either 
by the radical mechanism [209,210] where aromatic sulfur compounds 
react with bromine radical which is formed by homolytic cleavage [211] 
of molecular bromine on sonication or by direct reaction [212] with Br2 
formed. Bromine radical can also be formed by the reaction of hydrogen 
peroxide with bromide anion [213]. 
The reason for the absence of intermediates can be explained as 
follows: the standard reduction potential [214] of fluorine and HP is E◦
(V) = +2.87 and E ◦(V) = +1.77, respectively. In case of quaternary 
ammonium salt containing fluoride anion, H2O2 cannot oxidize the 
fluoride anion to fluorine as the standard reduction potential of F2/F− is 
+2.87 V. Therefore, fluoride-containing organosulfur compounds are 
not found in the reaction products. But as a result of the dissociation of 
the quaternary ammonium salts containing the other halide anions 
except fluoride in aqueous acidic media, the halide ions reduce 
hydrogen peroxide to water, causing the decomposition of hydrogen 
peroxide [215]. For example, when TOAB is used, HP in the aqueous 
acidic phase is reduced by oxidizing the bromide anion released by 
dissociation [216] of the quaternary ammonium salt in water according 
to the following reaction as E◦ (V) of Br2 is + 1.07 [214].
Catalytic decomposition [217,218] of HP in acidic medium in the 
presence of bromide ion is as follows: 
H2O2(aq) + 2Br−aq + 2H+
aq →Br2 + 2H2O (1)  
H2O2(aq) + Br2(aq) → O2 + 2Br− + 2H+ (2) 
Br2 formed in reaction 1 reacts with H2O2 in reaction 2 forming 
bromide ion again. The sum of reaction 1 and 2 is written as 
2H2O2(aq)→2H2O(l) + O2(g)
Br2, which is formed according to reaction (1), participates in 
bromination reaction with sulfur compounds in organic phase and forms 
bromo intermediates. Besides, as mentioned before, bromination reac-
tion can be carried out by bromine radical Br· formed by homolytic 
decomposition of Br2 molecule under US. The reason of the decreased 
desulfurization in this case can be explained as follows: as HP is 
decomposed in an acidic environment, the amount of peroxo- 
phosphotungstate formed in situ may decrease significantly. Addition-
ally, a small amount of peroxo-phosphotungstate, which has a higher 
ability to oxidize organic compounds than hydrogen peroxide [219], 
reacts very quickly with Br2 in the medium, causing the amount of 
peroxo-phosphotungstate to decrease much more. Therefore, the 
desulfurization under US can be significantly lower. In the case of the 
quaternary ammonium salt containing fluoride for the same alkyl chain 
length, HP is not reduced by fluoride, thus high desulfurization effi-
ciencies can be achieved by the high amount of peroxotungstate formed 
and no intermediates are formed. A similar phenomenon can occur when 
carboxylic acids such as formic acid are used instead of phosphotungstic 
acid. The reaction mechanism under ultrasound irradiation in the 
Scheme 4. The formation mechanism of brominated compounds.  
presence of a quaternary ammonium salt with bromide anion can be 
explained as follows: 
Br − Br→ Br⋅ + Br⋅ (3)  
H2O2→2OH⋅ (4)  
HCOOOH ⇌ HCOO⋅+ HO⋅ (5)  
H2O2 + Br⋅→HO2⋅+ HBr (6)  
HO2⋅ + H2O2→HO⋅+ O2 + H2O (7)  
HO⋅ + H2O2→HO2⋅ + H2O (8)  
Br⋅ + Br⋅→ Br2 (9)  
HO⋅ + HO⋅→ H2O2 (10)  
HO⋅ + Br⋅→HOBr (11)  
HO2⋅ + Br⋅→ HOOBr (12) 
Accordingly, Br2 formed through the reaction 1, the PFA formed in- 
situ and HP in the reaction solution bring about a series of reaction 3–12 
generating hydroxyl [158,161,220] and bromine radicals [211] by the 
decomposition of PFA and HP and the homolytic bond cleavage of Br2. 
Consequently, the hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals play a dominant 
role in oxidation of the organosulfur compounds. In a study [221] in 
which HP reacts with FA at 30 ◦C in the presence of TBAB, it was 
confirmed by titrimetric analysis that the HP concentration decreased 
significantly by the decomposition of HP and the peroxyformic acid 
concentration was too low. The change of the transparent color of the 
aqueous solution containing HP, FA and PFA in the absence of TBAB to 
the yellow color of the bromine water formed by the dissolution of Br2 in 
water in the presence of TBAB is an additional indicative of the 
decomposition. The resulting performic acid (or peracetic acid formed in 
the case of using acetic acid) can also react as follows: 
RCOOOH + 2Br− + 2H+ →RCOOH + H2O + Br2 (13)  
where R is H or CH3 and its concentration may decrease depending on 
the concentration of Br ion in the medium. 
Moreover, formic acid can react with the resulting Br2 according to 
the following reaction [222,223] (14), thus causing formic acid con-
centration to decrease. 
HCOOH + Br2 →CO2 + 2H+ + 2Br− (14) 
In the reaction mechanism in the case of using HP, FA and TOAF, 
peroxyformic acid generates formyloxyl radical and hydroxyl radical by 
homolytic cleavage under US [220]. As a result of the reaction of per-
oxyformic acid with hydroxyl radicals, formyl radical and peroxyformyl 
radical are formed, which is similar to the reactions [224] of peracetic 
acid with the hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, in addition to the hydroxyl 
radicals formed and the high concentration of performic acid, highly 
reactive formyloxyl and peroxyformyl radicals may also be responsible 
for the high desulfurization. 
Diesel fuel [208] containing 0.1 g TOAF was undergone ODS reac-
tion (followed by extraction four times at acetonitrile/oil 1:1 mass ratio 
at room temperature for 1.5 min each) with an equal volume of 30 vol% 
HP solution containing 0.2 g of phosphotungstic acid under the same US 
frequency and power at the same temperature as the previous study 
[207]. After UAODS reactions of 10 min followed by extraction four 
times, a sulfur removal of 95, 98.8, 87.5, 99.9 and 96.1% was achieved 
from F-76 containing 4222 ppmw S, MGO containing 1710 ppmw S, JP- 
5 containing 113.7 ppmw S, JP-8 containing 863 ppmw S and trans-
portation fuel containing 259 ppmw S, respectively. In addition, after a 
98.8% UAODS yield from MGO containing 1710 ppm S in the presence 
of TOAF, the aqueous phase was reused for two fresh MGO samples with 
1710 ppmw S each in the presence and absence of TOAF and a UAODS of 
98.15 and 96.01%, respectively, was obtained. Again, under the same 
conditions, this time using dilute HP (3 vol%), a UAODS of 97.90 and 
94.8% was obtained for MGO and F-76, respectively. It was stated that 
after the UAODS reaction of organic sulfur compounds, 99.49% of the 
tungsten remained in the aqueous phase according to ICP analysis, 
hence it could be completely recovered. 
In a study [225] investigating the effect of quaternary ammonium 
salts with four different alkyl lengths as PTC on UAODS, using PTC 
(optimum concentration 0.0116 mol L–1) in the range of 0.03–0.25 g, 
12 mL 30% HP and 12 mL formic acid, 28.37, 42.37, 70.02, 86.57 and 
94.67% sulfur removal, respectively, were obtained without PTC and in 
the presence of TMAB, TEAB, TPAB and TBAB at 50 ◦C in 1.5 h under 
direct US for 0.028 mL of thiophene dissolved in 24 mL of n-heptane. 
The highest desulfurization with TBAB was attributed to the bigger 
radius (thus more stable complex formation [HCOOO––Q—Br] by 
higher electron delocalization) of the phase transfer cation TBA+
compared to the radii of the other phase transfer cations for the transfer 
of [HCOOO–] to the organic phase in the presence of the same anion 
(Br–) and the higher extraction constant of TBAB. It was revealed that 
the reaction follows pseudo first order kinetics. 
In a study [226] in which the effect of two different types of 
continuous flow reactors on UAODS (followed by extraction at aceto-
nitrile/oil 1: 1 mass ratio at room temperature for 1.5 min with vigorous 
shaking) of MGO was investigated, a 92.74% sulfur removal was per-
formed using 25 g 30 vol% HP, 0.1 g TOAF, 0.2 g phosphotungstic acid 
under 600 W US in power at 70 ◦C in 20 min for treating 20 g MGO 
containing 1710 ppmw total S in a probe-type reactor operating at 
20 kHz, while using 625 g 30 vol% HP, 2.5 g TOAF, 5 g of phospho-
tungstic acid to treat 500 g of MGO per h in a portable tubular sonor-
eactor operating at 40 kHz, a desulfurization degree of 92.36 and 
89.78% was achieved at 25 ◦C for 100 W US power-60 min and 200 W 
US power-30 min, respectively. Then, this tubular sonoreactor was 
scaled up to a treatment rate of 12.5 lb MGO h− 1 and a 92.42% desul-
furization performance was accomplished using 7.09 kg 30 vol% HP, 
56.75 g TOAF and 28.13 g phosphotungstic acid under 100 W US power 
at 25 ◦C in 60 min. It has also been stated that sonoreactors can be 
connected in parallel to treat more fuel (25 lb h− 1) with the same 
removal percentage. In addition, by using diluted HP (3 vol%), a sulfur 
removal of 91% was reached in this sonoreactor in 120 min. Moreover, it 
is predicted that chemical costs can be reduced by recycling the pro-
cessed phosphotungstic acid, TOAF and HP by connecting sonoreactors 
in parallel to treat larger quantities of fuel (four times the recycle rate) 
and electricity consumption can be reduced by using low power US. 
Thus, in terms of total cost, it was reported that this parallel sonoreactor 
type has the potential to be applied in large-scale processes and has a 
greater advantage over batch-operated probe-type reactors for industrial 
and commercial applications. 
In a study [227] where ionic liquid was used instead of the aqueous 
phase, 97.6, 99.4 and 98.9% sulfur removal (followed by stirring for 
170 min), respectively, was obtained from 511 ppmw thiophene, 524 
ppmw benzothiophene and 530 ppmw dibenzothiophene using 5 g 
30 vol% HP, 1.5 g 20% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.3 g TOAF at 50 ◦C in 
10 min in the presence of 5 g of 1-n-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium meth-
ylsulfate ionic liquid under 600 W and 20 kHz direct US. A 100% 
desulfurization was achieved by applying the same conditions for Navy 
diesel (F-76) containing 4220 ppmw total S instead of model com-
pounds. It is reported that the limitation of this method is that the ionic 
liquid used can extract sulfur-free aromatic compounds present in the 
fuel. 
Nowadays, due to the increase in oil consumption, urban and in-
dustrial wastes have been used as an energy source. In the presence of 
0.1 g TOAB, 30 vol% HP and 0.2 g phosphotungstic acid, a sulfur 
removal [228] of 27.5 and 61.8% (followed by extraction three times at 
acetonitrile/oil 1: 1 mass ratio with vigorous agitation at room 
temperature for two min each) under 20 kHz direct US at 88 ◦C in 
20 min, respectively, was achieved from pyrolysis oil containing 8800 
ppmw total S obtained by pyrolysis of the waste tire at 650 ◦C for use as 
clean fuel and also diesel fuel containing 960 ppmw total S. As high 
carbon black and different hydrocarbon compounds in pyrolysis oil led 
to low desulfurization efficiency, after UAODS reaction, oxidized com-
pounds were adsorbed in a 6-cm-length column filled with 30 g Al2O3 
and a sulfur removal of 68.2 and 99.7% was performed for pyrolysis oil 
and diesel, respectively. Nevertheless, this sulfur removal value was not 
considered sufficient as pyrolysis oil contains more benzothiophene and 
thiophene groups with the lowest ODS reactivity compared to diesel fuel 
according to GC-SCD analysis. Therefore, two continuous UAODS re-
actors were connected in series and a desulfurization efficiency of 89% 
was obtained for the pyrolysis oil containing 0.88 wt% total S under the 
same UAODS reaction conditions, followed by adsorption in a 6-cm- 
length column filled with 30 g Al2O3. 
A series of UAODS experiments [229] were conducted by selecting 
sonication time, thiophene solution/phosphotungstic acid mass ratio, 
thiophene solution/HP mass ratio and thiophene solution/TOAB mass 
ratio as independent variables. At the optimum conditions found by 
principal component analysis (T:HP:TOAB:Phosphotungstic 
acid = 1:1.5:0.005:0.01 mass ratio), an approximately 73.5% conver-
sion of thiophene at 500 ppmw concentration to its sulfones has been 
carried out in the range from 75 to 85 ◦C in 20 min under 20 kHz direct 
US. The same conditions were applied to solutions of other model sulfur 
compounds and the ODS reactivity following the pseudo first-order re-
action kinetics was in the order: 4,6-DMDBT > 4-MDBT >DBT > 2- 
MBT > BT > T. It was explained that the low reactivity of thiophene is 
due to the low electron density on S atom and the relatively high reac-
tion temperature near the boiling point (84 ◦C) of thiophene. 
The conversion of 99% (55.5% at 0.02 M HP) and 99.9% (99.1% at 
0.02 M HP), respectively, was achieved from model fuel 1 (500 µg BT 
mL− 1) and model fuel 2 (500 µg DBT mL− 1) using 0.2 g phosphotungstic 
acid, 0.1 g TOAB, 0.65 M HP at 80 ◦C in 15 min under 20 kHz direct US 
[230]. The activation energies for the oxidation reactions of DBT and BT 
following the pseudo first-order reaction kinetics were found to be 45.01 
and 60.52 kJ mol− 1, respectively. 
An economic analysis of the study [228] was also evaluated. A sulfur 
removal [231] (each followed by adsorption in a 6-cm-length column 
filled with Al2O3) of 68 and 90.91%, respectively, was obtained from 
pyrolysis oil with high-sulfur content (8800 ppmw total S) obtained by 
pyrolysis of waste tires in one continuous sonoreactor and two contin-
uous sonoreactors connected in series at pyrolysis fuel/phosphotungstic 
acid 100:1 mass ratio, 30 vol% HP sol./TOAB 250:1 mass ratio and the 
convenient feed rates of aqueous and organic phase in such a way that 
fuel/water volume ratio is 1:1 in the reactors at room temperature and 
atmospheric pressure in 20 min under 20 kHz direct US. As a result of the 
benefit-cost analysis, it is explained that a single UAODS unit can be 
feasible at industrial scales as the benefit/cost ratio is 1.16 and 0.86 for a 
single reactor and reactors in series, respectively. A recycle rate of 95, 
92, 99 (which is obtained by regeneration at 500–600 ◦C) and 95% was 
reached for phosphotungstic acid, HP, Al2O3 and PTC, respectively, in a 
single sonoreactor. 
A 47% yield (which is higher than the desulfurization efficiency at 
atmospheric pressure under the same conditions) of UAODS was ob-
tained for the model fuel [232] with 100 ppmw DBT concentration 
prepared by dissolving DBT in toluene using 0.05 g of TOAB, 2 mL of 
30 vol% HP and 4 mL of formic acid at 25 ◦C in 90 min under high 
pressure of 1.8 bar and 35 kHz and 70 W indirect US. It was explained 
that this relatively high desulfurization is caused by the stable complex 
formation of TOAB with HP and the elimination of transient cavitation 
by high pressure, thus preventing the production of reducing species 
such as H2 and CO, which consume oxidizing species formed by the 
collapse of transient cavitation bubbles in the organic phase. It was 
stated that as US emulsifies the aqueous and organic phase highly (hence 
creating a higher interface area) and the mass transfer resistance is 
relatively large in the absence of PTC under mechanical mixing, the 
effect of PTC under US on sulfur removal is lower than that under 
stirring. 
In a similar study [233] where the effects of PTC on UAODS were 
elucidated by cavitation bubble dynamics and thermodynamic analysis, 
at HP/HCOOH 0.6 molar ratio, HP/TBAB 16.11 molar ratio (0.5 g of 
TBAB) and solvent/oxidant 3.33 vol ratio, a sulfur reduction of 
approximately 96.65 and 77.63% was achieved from 20 mL of model 
fuel containing 100 ppmw DBT in toluene with 35 kHz and 70 W indirect 
US at 40 ◦C in 90 min under atmospheric pressure and nitrogen atmo-
sphere of 1.8 bar, respectively. On the contrary to the study [232], it was 
reported that this low desulfurization at high pressure occurs due to 
lower emulsification and lower interfacial area compared to the situa-
tion at atmospheric pressure although transient cavitation is eliminated. 
It was declared that DBT undergoes almost complete oxidation due to 
the intensive microconvection with the help of US and the enhanced 
UAODS by transferring fast the oxidant anion of PTC to the organic 
phase by a large amount of PTC and oxidant in the medium compared to 
DBT although UAODS in the presence of PTC is based on an ionic 
mechanism (with higher activation energy than the activation energy of 
the UAODS reaction in the absence of PTC) rather than radical mecha-
nism. In addition, it was reported that the effect of PTC under me-
chanical mixing is less pronounced than the effect under US due to the 
higher activation energy, the higher ΔG and the lower − ΔS value of the 
stirring system compared to the ultrasonic system. 
UAODS reactions [234] of two model fuels containing 500 ppmw 
model sulfur compound each prepared by dissolving BT and DBT in 
toluene were carried out using 50 wt% HP and TOAB with different 
polyoxomethalate catalysts at 30, 50 and 70 ◦C in the range of 2 to 
30 min and it was found that the highest reactivity was obtained with a 
DBT conversion of 94.8% after 30 min of reaction by using NaPW under 
500 W power 20 kHz and 40% amplitude (200 W power output) direct 
US at 70 ◦C. According to the BT and DBT conversion results, it was 
found that the UAODS catalytic activity was in the order 
Na3PW12O40 >H3PW12O40 >H3PMo12O40 >H4SiW12O40 as well as an 
increase in sulfur removal with increasing temperature for each catalyst. 
It was stated that the reason for the activity order 
H3PW12O40 >H3PMo12O40 is that the peroxotungsten complex formed 
is more catalytically active than the peroxomolybdenum complex even 
though the standard reduction potential of Mo(VI) is higher than W(VI). 
However, it was noted that the acidity of the aqueous phase in the case 
of phosphotungstic acid does not affect UAODS yield much when 
compared to the desulfurization results obtained in the case of the most 
active catalyst, sodium phosphotungstate. 
At optimum conditions (21.96 mL oxidant volume, 1 g catalyst, 0.1 g 
PTC and 100% amplitude) found by RSM, in which volume of oxidant 
(40 vol% HP), catalyst (phosphotungstic acid) mass, TOAB mass and 
ultrasonic wave amplitude are selected as independent variables, using 
Minitab 15 software, a desulfurization (followed by extraction at 
acetonitrile/oil 1:1 mass ratio) of 94.5% for gas oil [235] containing 250 
ppmw total S was performed at 65 ◦C in 20 min under 20 kHz and 750 W 
direct US. In this study, it was reported that the importance of process 
independent variables and their interactions according to UAODS results 
was in the order oxidant volume > ultrasonic wave amplitude > oxidant 
volume × ultrasonic wave amplitude > catalyst mass > PTC 
mass > oxidant volume × PTC mass > catalyst mass × PTC mass > PTC 
mass × ultrasonic wave amplitude and after a certain HP volume, excess 
HP causes a reduction in sulfur removal by creating a radical scavenging 
effect. 
In a study [236] aimed at reducing the kinematic viscosity and sulfur 
of diesel oil, using the Box-Behnken design as RSM by Design Expert 
v.7.0.0 software, HP volume (X1), acetic acid volume (X2), PTC (TOAB) 
mass (X3), the amount of transition metal catalyst (phosphotungstic 
acid) (X4) and time (X5) were chosen as independent variables. As a 
result of the screening of the variables, time was found to be insignifi-
cant with respect to the desulfurization performances. After applying 
RSM by screening out the time variable, the importance of the relevant 
four variables and their interactions with each other for UAODS ac-
cording to the results of ANOVA was in the order 
X1
2 > X4
2 > X3
2 > X2
2 > X1X2 > X2 > X1. Under the optimum conditions 
found (13.17 mL HP, 17.26 mL acetic acid, 0.15 g TOAB and 1.5 g 
phosphotungstic acid), an S removal (followed by extraction one time at 
166.7 g L–1 NaOH (caustic soda solution)/oil 1:1 vol ratio for 2 min) of 
68.85% was achieved from diesel oil containing 5044 ppmw total S at 
50 ◦C in 5 min under 20 kHz frequency, 700 W power and 40% ampli-
tude direct US. After a certain amount of PTC, the mass transfer was 
slowed down due to the formation of a thick turbid layer in the mixture, 
thus leading to a reduction in UAODS. A similar trend of sulfur removal 
to the trend with PTC has been also observed for the transition metal 
catalyst, but due to the large volume of phosphotungstic acid and the 
small surface area of the particles. As a result of the screening analysis, it 
was stated that as the viscosity of diesel fuel, which has a kinematic 
viscosity of 3.96 cSt at 40 ◦C, decreases by max 20% after UAODS pro-
cess, the relevant independent variables have no effect on the viscosity, 
and therefore the kinematic viscosity as a dependent variable was not 
taken into account. 
In a study [237] investigating the mechanism of the UAODS system 
in the presence of different catalysts (phosphotungstic acid, acetic acid 
and formic acid), it has been underlined that the desulfurization reaction 
is based on the ionic mechanism (caused by the transport of the peroxo- 
metallate anion and the anion of peracids from the aqueous phase into 
the interface by the lipophilic cation of PTC) in the presence of phase 
transfer catalyst, whereas in the absence of PTC, the desulfurization 
reaction is based on the radical-based mechanism (caused by the for-
mation of active oxygen radicals such as acetyl radical CH3CO⋅ and 
hydroperoxy radical HO2⋅ by resulting in decomposition of peracids and 
HP by the collapse of cavitation bubbles formed). It was found that the 
sulfur removal efficiencies achieved at 1.8 bar for all three catalysts 
were lower than the desulfurization performances at atmospheric pres-
sure, mainly due to the reduction in microconvection intensity within 
the mixture under high pressure, resulting in lower mass transport. In 
this study, in contrast to the other two studies [164,233] in which n- 
hexane and toluene were used as solvents, it was reported that as n- 
decane has a high boiling point and therefore has a very low vapor 
pressure, no reducing species such as H2 and CO, which reduces 
oxidizing species, were formed as a result of ultrasonic cavitation at 
atmospheric pressure. At n-decane (organic phase)/HP (aqueous phase) 
volume ratio of 10, a maximum desulfurization of about 74% with a rate 
constant of 0.0155 min− 1 was performed using 60 mg L–1 TBAB, 4 mL FA 
and 2 mL HP at 50 ◦C in 90 min under 35 kHz and 70 W indirect US for 
the model fuel containing 100 ppmw DBT in n-decane. Excessive use of 
PTC prevented mass transfer, decreasing UAODS relatively. The excess 
of the transition metal catalyst acts as an emulsion in the mixture by 
covering the emulsion droplets with a thin film and creating a barrier in 
the mass transport of the oxidant into the interface, thus causing the 
UAODS yield to be levelled off. 
The optimum conditions, which led to a sulfur removal of 60.75% 
without extraction, found for the batch reactor in the study [236], were 
applied to the continuous tube-type flow-through sonoreactor [238] by 
scaling up 2.5 times and under direct US with two transducers operating 
at a frequency of 20 kHz and a sonication power of 48 W each, a sulfur 
removal efficiency of 80.79% was achieved from final gas oil containing 
5044 ppmw total S using 30 mL HP, 45 mL acetic acid, 0.375 g TOAB 
and 3.75 g phosphotungstic acid at equal feed and outlet flow rates in 
5 min. It was explained that this higher conversion compared to that in 
the batch reactor is due to the lack of temperature control (hence leading 
to an increase in the temperature of the mixture as a result of cavitation 
under US) in the continuously operating sonoreactor and the fact that 
every fluid element does not reside for exactly 5 min as in the batch 
reactor (i.e., resided for 5 min on average). The kinematic viscosity of 
the relevant gas oil decreased by 9.40% within 5 min under the UAODS 
conditions, while a 13.5% reduction in kinematic viscosity was achieved 
by using US alone in the same minute. It has been noted that US gives off 
some of its energy to split HP and peracetic acid into their radicals under 
oxidation conditions, while under US alone, it converts the gas oil into 
lighter fractions by giving off its energy to cleave the C - C and C - S 
bonds. However, for the cases of US alone and UAODS, no significant 
change was observed in kinematic viscosity at treatment times of 
15 min, compared to the kinematic viscosity before the treating of gas 
oil. In the absence of acetic acid, besides final gas oil containing 5044 
ppmw total S, other feedstocks (atmospheric gas oil with 10,700 ppmw 
total S, atmospheric kerosene with 4980 ppmw S, Isomax gas oil with 
181 ppmw total S) were subjected to oxidation reaction under direct US 
with 48 W max power and it was stated that the UAODS efficiency is in 
the order atmospheric kerosene > atmospheric gas oil > final gas 
oil > Isomax gas oil and the sulfur removal from high-sulfur gas oils is 
higher. As for kerosene, since lighter fractions as well as the small 
number of condensed aromatic sulfur compounds (thus lower specific 
gravity, lower kinematic viscosity, and lower boiling range of kerosene, 
compared to gas oils) were present, the best desulfurization improve-
ment has been achieved. 
In a study [239] where crude oil containing 2133 ppmw total S was 
desulfurized and upgraded (simultaneous extraction and oxidation 
process) under 40 kHz indirect US, 65.28% S removal was achieved with 
200 ppm oxidant, 60 ppm demulsifier dosage and distilled water at 65 ◦C 
in 10 min and it was determined that the physical properties of the 
treated crude oil have improved (ie, decrease in density, decrease in 
kinematic viscosity at 20 ◦C, increase in cetane number, decrease in 10% 
carbon residue on residuum/%). 
At optimum conditions (17 min, 180.3 mmol HP and 25 ppm FeSO4) 
found by applying RSM based on central composite design (CCD) in 
which HP amount, catalyst (FeSO4) amount and time are selected as 
independent variables, a 90% desulfurization of gas oil [240] containing 
9500 ppmw total S was performed by three-stage UAODS process (fol-
lowed by extraction three times at a volume ratio of methanol/oil 4:5 at 
room temperature for 2 min each after every UAODS reaction) using 
isobutanol as PTC in the presence of acetic acid (ie, in acidic medium 
where the catalyst is active at pH less than 3) at 62 ◦C under 24 kHz and 
400 W direct US. In the presence of TOAB as PTC instead of isobutanol, 
21.99% sulfur removal from gas oil was performed by a one-step UAODS 
process under the same conditions, while in the presence of isobutanol, a 
67.70% reduction in total sulfur was achieved by one-step UAODS 
(followed by extraction). Moreover, it was stated that isobutanol is very 
cheap, can be mixed into the fuel and burned, and it has economic 
viability as it does not require separation after UAODS reactions. After 
the oxidation reactions, the extractions with methanol were carried out 
under US and the sulfur removal was the same as that obtained by the 
extraction under stirring, thus demonstrating that ultrasound has no 
effect on extraction in this study. According to the F-test of the regres-
sion model, it was revealed that the effect of time variable and time ×HP 
interaction on UAODS is not of importance. 
At the optimum conditions (16.4 min sonication time, 122.1 mg 
TOAB, organic phase/aqueous phase 29.7 mL/10.3 mL volume ratio and 
204.8 ppm Fe(VI) for BT, 29.5 min sonication time , 111.6 mg TOAB, 
organic phase/aqueous phase 16.2 mL/23.8 mL volume ratio and 
245.3 ppm Fe(VI) for DBT) found by applying RSM based on BBD for 
which the ultrasonication time, TOAB amount, organic phase/aqueous 
phase volume ratio and Ferrate concentration in ppm unit are selected as 
independent variables, a sulfur removal of 88.3 and 91.8%, respectively, 
was obtained using 0.1 N acetic acid (pH = 4) from two model fuels (500 
ppmw BT in toluene and 500 ppmw DBT in toluene) at 70 ◦C [241]. The 
optimum conditions found for BT and DBT were individually applied to 
diesel fuel containing 1428.6 ppmw total S, resulting in 85.7% BT and 
91% DBT reduction in diesel oil. It was explained that these lower 
desulfurization yields compared to model fuels is due to the presence of 
many different sulfur compounds in diesel fuel that make oxidation 
difficult. The effect of different amounts of Ferrate and TOAB on UAODS 
was also investigated under 20 kHz frequency, 500 W and 40% 
amplitude direct US. When the ferrate concentration increased to a 
certain value, sulfur removal gave a maximum and after a certain value, 
sulfur removal decreased. This was attributed to the fact that as the 
ferrate concentration increased, the pH of the aqueous phase slightly 
increased (i.e., more basic medium), thus leading to a decrease in the 
oxidation capacity of the ferrate in basic medium (lower reduction po-
tential (+0.72 V) in basic medium [242]). However, the standard 
reduction potential [243] of ferrate in acidic medium is + 2.20 V. With 
the excessive use of TOAB, the sulfur removal decreased, which has been 
attributed to the slowing of mass transfer due to turbidity of the mixture 
and to sterically prevention of electrophilic oxidation of sulfur com-
pounds by the high concentration of alkyl groups. According to ANOVA 
results, it was reported that OP/AP volume ratio, PTC × (OP:AP) volume 
ratio interaction and PTC2 have the greatest effect on UAODS for BT, 
whereas OP/AP, US time × PTC interaction, US time × Ferrate concen-
tration interaction, PTC × ferrate concentration, PTC2, (OP:AP)2 and 
(Ferrate conc.)2 have the greatest effect on the sulfur removal for DBT. It 
was determined that the amount of PTC for both model sulfur com-
pounds is not important to UAODS. It has been pronounced that potas-
sium ferrate has higher oxidation capacity and higher stability than HP 
and HP decomposes thermally at high temperature despite its lower 
cost, which is another important advantage of this process. Moreover, 
thermal decomposition [244] of potassium ferrate occurs above 198 ◦C. 
The oxidation mechanism is based on the formation of protonated Fe(VI) 
as a reactive complex [245–247] (which is much stronger oxidant than 
FeO4
2 − ) by reaction of ferrate with acetic acid and, subsequently the 
transfer of the complex into the organic phase (where organic sulfur 
compounds are oxidized) by binding to the lipophilic cation of the phase 
transfer agent. 
By applying the Pareto-optimal analysis-based fuzzy logic model 
[248] in which US time, TOAB amount, organic phase/aqueous phase 
volume ratio and ferrate concentration are selected as four independent 
variables to maximize the sulfur reduction and, also US energy con-
sumption, TOAB amount and the Ferrate amount are selected as three 
independent variables to minimize the operating cost, in the presence of 
acetic acid (pH = 4) at 70 ◦C under 20 kHz direct US with 200 W power 
output (500 W, 40% amplitude), it was reported that a conversion of 
93.79% was achieved per operating cost of $ 0.830 at the optimum 
conditions (15.86 min US time, 107.7 mg TOAB, 30 mL:10 mL organic 
phase/aqueous phase volume ratio and 100 ppm ferrate concentration) 
for 500 ppmw BT, while a conversion of 88.36% was achieved per $ 
0.769 operating cost at the optimum operating conditions (10 min US 
time, 100.1 mg TOAB, organic phase/aqueous phase volume ratio 
16.96 mL/23.04 mL and 300 ppm ferrate concentration) for 500 ppmw 
DBT. It was shown that the desulfurization efficiencies obtained in this 
study are comparable with two sonoreactors in series in the previous 
studies [228,231], whereas the operating cost in this study is lower than 
that in the continuous sonoreactors connected in series, hence having 
the potential to be applicable for scaling up purposes. 
3. Outlooks 
UAODS is performed at relatively much lower temperatures (i.e., in 
the range of room temperature to 90 ◦C), atmospheric or near atmo-
spheric pressures, and generally shorter times than HDS. Process effi-
ciency in UAODS is very important in terms of commercial applicability. 
In addition, US power intensity [125], defined as the power transferred 
to the liquid per surface area of the ultrasonic probe, and amplitude are 
important. It is beneficial to use low-amplitude ultrasound from the 
point of lower power and lower electricity consumption. 
As mentioned before, reaction and ultrasonic parameters have a very 
important effect on desulfurization. Increasing the amount of PTC up to 
a certain value improves UAODS by allowing more PTC-oxidant com-
plexes to transfer into the organic phase and then ODS decreases slightly 
as a result of the slowing down of mass transfer between the aqueous- 
organic phase in the liquid mixture due to the formation of a thick 
turbid layer above an optimum amount of PTC [236,237,241]. As 
known, the reaction rate constant increases exponentially with 
increasing temperature according to Arrhenius equation, consequently 
increasing the reaction rate as well [249]. Nevertheless, above an op-
timum temperature, the collapse intensity of cavitation decreases as 
more solvent vapors will accumulate in cavitation bubble [120,250,251] 
in addition to decomposition of HP into water and oxygen, thus 
decreasing UAODS yield. Temperature can be increased unless the 
collapse intensity of the cavitation bubble reduces the total reaction rate 
[200]. Above an optimum reaction volume, sulfur removal decreases 
due to the lower ultrasonic power density [78,196]. With increasing HP 
concentration (i.e., a more concentrated HP solution) up to a certain 
value in aqueous phase, UAODS usually increases due the formation of 
more HO⋅ radicals than HP [65,126]. Above an optimum concentration, 
HP can have a scavenging effect on hydroxyl radicals [157]. The sulfur 
removal increases up to a certain ultrasonic intensity, whereas dense 
bubble clouds, which show the cavitation shielding effect, will accu-
mulate near the probe above a certain intensity [184]. Therefore, 
UAODS yield can decrease at high intensities and consequently, an op-
timum US intensity is required. Although generally, dissolved gases such 
as helium and oxygen in liquid mixture act as nucleation sites, facili-
tating the formation of the cavitation bubble, reaction rates change 
depending on the solubility, the thermal conductivity and the specific 
heat of the gases used [91,200]. However, dissolved gas above a certain 
concentration in cavitation bubble can cushion the collapse of the 
cavitation bubble, consequently causing a lower collapse intensity 
[252,253]. Therefore, it is necessary to find the optimum dissolved gas 
concentration in liquid mixture to increase the UAODS reaction rates 
unless the dissolved gas quantity decreases the cavitation effect. Pres-
sure can have two opposite effects. As pressure increases, the intensity of 
the cavitation bubble implosion increases [254]. However, above an 
optimum pressure, much less bubbles, which can have almost no impact 
on overall reaction rate, can be produced due to increasing cavitation 
threshold of the liquid mixture [200]. The effect of pressure on sulfur 
removal varies as shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Information 
and the boiling point of the solvent in the organic phase or the boiling 
range of fuel becomes crucial. For low boiling point solvents such as 
hexane, toluene, it is observed that sulfur removal increases with 
increasing pressure at relatively low operating temperature [164,232], 
while sulfur removal decreases with increasing pressure at high oper-
ating temperature [233]. For high boiling point solvents, it was reported 
that sulfur removal decreases with increasing pressure at relatively high 
temperature [197,237]. These differences observed in sulfur removal at 
high pressures can be attributed to a decrease or increase in the collapse 
intensity of cavitation bubbles. Nonetheless, much more effort is needed 
to establish a clear relationship between pressure and temperature in 
terms of cavitation intensity. In summary, in order to maximize total 
UAODS reaction rate, it is necessary to consider in combination the ef-
fects of reaction and ultrasonic parameters on UAODS yield. 
Desulfurization process efficiency (DPE =UAODS yield/MR(H2O2/ 
S)) can be defined as the UAODS yield per molar ratio of reactants used 
(i.e., the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to sulfur). The less the 
amount of HP, the larger the quantity of fuel used to remove sulfur and 
the higher the UAODS yield, the higher the process efficiency. Figs. 4, 5 
and 6 show DPEs calculated using heterogeneous catalysts, homoge-
neous catalysts in the absence of PTC and homogeneous catalysts in the 
presence of PTC, respectively. The operating conditions of UAODS re-
actions with heterogeneous catalyst, homogeneous catalyst in the 
absence of PTC and homogeneous catalyst in the presence of PTC are 
given in Tables S2, S3 and S4, respectively. From the three figures, it can 
be seen that the DPEs under indirect US (ultrasonic bath) are mostly 
lower than the DPEs under direct US. This low process efficiency can be 
attributed to the fact that the intensity of the indirect US (in this case, the 
ultrasonic wave generated by the transducer passes first through the 
walls of the sample container and then through the liquid) is much lower 
compared to the intensity of ultrasound in direct contact with liquid 
using the ultrasonic probe [255]. Also, in an ultrasonic bath, ultrasonic 
wave cannot propagate equally in all directions into each fluid element 
in a liquid, thus resulting in heterogeneous dissipation [256–258]. 
It can be seen that in the case of using heterogeneous catalysts, the 
DPEs are generally higher than DPEs with and without PTC using ho-
mogeneous catalysts. These high DPEs can be due to both the adsorption 
of sulfur compounds on the catalyst surface and the oxidation of sulfur 
compounds by forming an active oxidizing complex caused by HP on the 
surface, as well as the adsorption of oxidized sulfur compounds. There 
are many advantages of using solid catalyst in liquid under US irradia-
tion: solid particles function as nucleation sites to form cavitation bub-
bles, thus causing free radicals to increase further. Sonication results in 
an increase in surface area by reducing the particle size of solid catalysts 
and inactive catalyst becomes reactive as a result of desorption of 
adsorbed sulfones (passivating surface coating) due to the surface 
cleaning caused by liquid jet streams which are formed by implosion of 
cavitation bubbles [259]. In addition, more collision occurs between 
reactants and catalysts due to microstreaming [250] and agglomeration

and 28 represent the references [183,189,184,185,180,195,197,181,179,182,178,187,188,161,186,172,174,196,173,175,171,169,162,166,165,170,163], 
respectively).*20 and 15.26 are DPE values calculated for DBT and real diesel oil, respectively, pertaining to reference [189]. 
of catalysts is prevented [260]. Moreover, the high heat generated by the 
collapse of cavitation bubbles near solid catalysts can propagate inside 
catalyst, consequently leading the reaction rate to be higher and it is 
emphasized that the largest sonochemical effect occurs in macropores 
>50 nm in diameter [261]. On the other hand, too many catalyst par-
ticles can attenuate US waves propagating through liquid [125]. 
Therefore, an optimum catalyst loading is necessary in UAODS 
reactions. 
There is an exception in the case of using potassium ferrate in Fig. 6. 
As potassium ferrate is a stronger oxidant in acidic environment than HP 
and the active complex consisting of ferrate and acetic acid has higher 
oxidation power than ferrate alone, DPEs are very high. 
DPEs for acetic acid-HP and formic acid-HP in Fig. 5 are generally 
higher than those for the phosphotungstic acid-HP system in Fig. 6, 
which is due to the small molecular size of acetic acid [262] (ca. 0.4 nm) 
and formic acid [263] (ca. 0.3 nm), thus alkyl substituted aromatic 
sulfur compounds do not cause steric hindrance. The reason that DPEs 
are lower in the case of using phosphotungstic acid-HP system in the 
presence of PTC in Fig. 6 compared to DPEs in the case of using ho-
mogeneous catalysts without PTC is that the alkyl groups adjacent to the 
sulfur atom of compounds such as 2,5-DMT, 4-MDBT and 4,6-DMDBT in 
fuel lead to the steric hindrance due to bulky size of the oxidizing pol-
yoxoperoxo complex composed of phosphotungstic acid and HP. How-
ever, when organic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid are used in 
combination with phosphotungstic acid, DPE increases considerably by 
creating a synergistic effect due to the polyoxoperoxo complexes and 
peracids formed [236,238]. The reason for using PTCs in the case of 
phosphotungstic acid is the transfer of the formed polyoxoperoxo 
complex anion to the organic phase, otherwise DPE without PTC may be 
low. Also, phosphotungstic acid decomposes as pH increases from 1 to 
8.3 [264] and thus an acidic medium is favorable to the UAODS re-
actions. Since phosphotungstic acid is thermally stable [265] up to 
400 ◦C, it can form stable polyoxoperoxo complexes with HP and hence 
ODS can be performed at relatively higher temperatures, which are 
below 100 ◦C, compared to the temperatures in the case of acetic acid 
and formic acid. Performic acid [266] and peracetic acid [267] undergo 
dramatically thermal decomposition, especially at temperatures of 45 ◦C 
and above. 
Formic acid and acetic acid have the capacity to extract sulfur 
compounds and peracids formed as a result of emulsification by US 
effect can easily be transferred into the organic phase or the organic- 
aqueous phase interface. Therefore, it can be deduced that PTC has no 
significant effect on DPE. In the studies in Fig. 6, it is seen that PTC is 
used in addition to phosphotungstic acid. The reason for using PTC may 
be due to the low desulfurization obtained by using phosphotungstic 
acid in the absence of PTC. 
In Fig. 4, modified Metal-organic Framework (MOF) was used in the 
study where DPE of 49, 43.5 and 35.5% was obtained. The reason for the 
high DPE can be both the entrapment of phosphotungstic acid into 
amino-functionalized MOF with large surface area and pore volume 
(hence aromatic sulfur compounds are effectively adsorbed and oxidized 
on phosphotungstic acid@TMU-17-NH2), and the simultaneous extrac-
tion of oxidized sulfur compounds using acetonitrile. In addition, ul-
trasonic synthesis, which is more environmentally friendly and 
performed at lower reaction time at room temperature than sol-
vothermal process carried out at high temperature, may have contrib-
uted to high desulfurization as MOFs synthesized under ultrasound have 
generally higher surface area, lower particle size, higher crystallinity, 
more uniform morphology and size distribution compared to those ob-
tained by conventional preparation methods. 
Reactor configurations also affect DPE. In Fig. 5, the high DPE of 
23.57 is due to the nozzle, through which the aqueous phase consisting 
of FA and HP flows in a very low amount (0.71 mL min− 1), placed just 
below the tip of ultrasonic probe, thus causing an increase in sulfur 
removal by generating active radicals in this efficient region and 
dispersing the aqueous phase more homogeneously into the organic 
phase. 
In ODS, ionic liquids have also been tried instead of the aqueous 
phase. However, their synthesis is generally high cost and it is difficult to 
transport them due to their high viscosity. In addition, as more US power 
is needed to fully emulsify the high viscosity ionic liquid phase and 
organic phase, the operating cost will increase due to electrical energy 
consumption. Moreover, since the ionic liquid loses its activity after a 
certain recycle, its regeneration will also lead to an additional cost. 
Therefore, the use of ionic liquids in continuous processes is not 
practical. 
In the studies, one of the biggest problems of UAODS is fuel loss 
during extraction and/or adsorption process to remove oxidized sulfur 
compounds after oxidative treatment. During the separation processes, 
other polar hydrocarbons in fuel pass into the extractant phase or are 
Fig. 6. DPEs with homogeneous catalysts in the presence of PTC (where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 represent the references 
[241,248,230,238,236,240,231,228,206,208,226,225,235,227,233,229,237,232,234], respectively).
adsorbed on the adsorbent. Although it has been shown in laboratory 
and pilot studies that the physicochemical properties of the fuel after the 
UAODS process change in acceptable ranges according to the fuel 
specifications for petroleum fractions, how these properties will change 
in large-scale industrial production is a separate research topic. In 
addition, the ultrasonic probe must be replaced with the new one as the 
tip surface erodes by pitting in long service life [125,268], otherwise it 
becomes inoperable. 
One of the biggest reasons for the widespread use of HDS is that it has 
a high fuel recovery as well as a very little negative effect on fuel 
properties. In addition, hydrotreatment of diesel consisting of paraffinic, 
aromatic and naphthenic components saturates the aromatic com-
pounds in the diesel, resulting in an increase in the cetane number 
[269]. 
After UAODS, how to eliminate the waste sulfones generated and 
accumulated is an environmental issue. Elemental sulfur, which is 
mainly used for sulfuric acid production [270], can be produced by the 
reaction of SO2 with H2S generated in HDS units after the waste sulfones 
are converted to SO2 as a result of thermal decomposition [271] by 
burning them in high temperature furnace operating at 1093–1427 ◦C in 
the Claus process [272,273] or by pyrolysis [274]. 
In a study [275] evaluating the desulfurization process economics by 
using Aspen Plus simulation, it has been shown that the UAODS process 
is not cost-effective for fuels containing high sulfur (i.e., in the range of 
several thousand ppmw) due to high chemical consumption to drasti-
cally reduce the sulfur content of fuel and very high amounts of 
extraction solvent required to separate the huge amounts of sulfones 
formed, therefore it is not competitive with HDS. Therefore, detailed 
research taking fuel loss into account is still needed to achieve cost 
savings and high sulfur removal in the UAODS process by using low 
amounts of reagents, performing reactions at the lowest possible tem-
perature in the shortest possible time and using the most efficient 
extraction solvent in the lowest possible amounts. 
Concluding remarks and future directions can be presented as 
follows:  
- In order to increase the sulfur removal per power density consumed 
as well as to reduce the process cost, one continuous-flow sonor-
eactor or two continuous-flow sonoreactors in series can be used at 
low flow rate of the aqueous phase feed and, short retention times. At 
high conversions, continuous sonoreactors can be connected in 
parallel to treat more fuel.  
- Desulfurization can be increased by the addition of heterogeneous 
catalysts to continuous sonoreactors connected in series.  
- Potassium ferrate with a much higher reduction potential than HP 
under acidic conditions can be activated by HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, 
HClO4 and HCOOH instead of CH3COOH. To reduce the process cost, 
UAODS reactions can be carried out using potassium ferrate in acidic 
medium in the absence of relatively expensive PTCs.  
- Low temperatures in the range of 20–40 ◦C favor UAODS reactions 
since the decomposition of performic and peracetic acid increases 
drastically above 40 ◦C in the case of homogeneous catalysts. To 
observe the change of concentration of peroxycarboxylic acid over 
time, the reactions of HP and carboxylic acids (i.e., HCOOH or 
CH3COOH) can be carried out at different temperatures, different 
times and various molar ratios in the absence of both PTC and 
organic phase under US irradiation and consequently, peroxyformic 
acid or peroxyacetic acid (HCOOOH or CH3COOOH) concentration 
at any time t during the reaction can be readily determined by 
titrimetric analysis. Eventually, the time, at which peroxyformic acid 
or peroxyacetic acid concentration is maximum, is found for each 
temperature. Therefore, UAODS reactions can be performed at those 
times, thus reducing the process cost due to short reaction times and 
increasing the sulfur removal efficiency. Alternatively, UAODS re-
actions can be performed at different temperatures and by taking an 
aliquot of the aqueous phase at certain times during the UAODS 
reaction for each temperature, the change of the concentration of the 
peroxycarboxylic formed can be followed by titrimetric analysis. 
Consequently, a relationship between the sulfur removal and per-
oxycarboxylic acid concentration can be established and sono- 
oxidative desulfurization reaction conditions can be optimized.  
- Indirect ultrasonic application in UAODS reactions is not as effective 
as direct US application from the point of view of DPE.
