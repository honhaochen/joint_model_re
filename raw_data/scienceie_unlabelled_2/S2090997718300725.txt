We have presented BVR surface photometry and geometric analyses for galaxy pair KPG 578 a, b (NGC 7537,
NGC 7541). The contour maps, BVR surface brightness profiles (SB) and geometric profiles (xc, yc, PA and
Ellip=1− b/a) have been used for each galaxy in the pair. The galaxy pair KPG 578 is an intermediate pair with
projected separation = −r 35.4 h kpcp 70
1 and relative velocity =vΔ 15 km/s. The total orbital mass of KPG 578 is
determined to be = ⊙M x M6. 03 10t
9 . While the total luminosity and the total orbital mass to the total lu-
minosity of KPG 578 are found to be = ⊙L x L4. 49 10t
10 and =M L 0.13t t M⊙/L⊙ respectively.
While it has been believed that the galaxy pair KPG 578 is non-interacting system, in this work we have found
that the galaxy pair KPG 578 has signs of interaction. The KPG 578a contains one short curved tidal tail in north-
east. The KPG 578b has two curved tidal tails: the first is long in west and the second is short in east. The
geometrical parameters of tidal tails (length (lt), thickness (ht) and area (At)) have been presented in this study.
1. Introduction
The galaxy pairs are considered as natural resources to study the
gravitational interaction between galaxies. They play a strong role for
increasing star formation (Bell et al., 2006, Lin et al., 2004, Bundy
et al., 2004, Patton et al., 2002, Carlberg et al., 2000, Patton et al.,
2000; Le F‘evre et al., 2000).
The KPG 578 is a pair of the two spiral galaxies from Karachentsev
catalog (1972). The galaxy KPG 578a (NGC 7537) is classified as
normal spiral Sbc. The galaxy KPG 578b (NGC 7541) is classified as
barred spiral SBc. The major diameter in the B-band at the isophotal
level 25mag/arcsec2 equals to 1.82 and 3.02 arcmin of KPG 578a and
KPG 578b respectively. The total magnitude in the B-band at the same
isophotal level equals to 12.68 ± 0.06 and 11.39 ± 0.09 of KPG 578a
and KPG 578b respectively, see Table 1.
Karachentsev (1987) gives the radial velocity as 2834 km/s and
2793 km/s of KPG 578a and KPG 578b respectively. The angular se-
paration between the pair is equals to 3.05 arcmin. The projected linear
separation equals to 33.3 kpc for Hubble con-
stant = − −H 75 h km s Mpc0 75
1 1. Karachentsev (1987) classified this
pair as an isolated pair without details about whether this pair re-
presents interacting galaxies or non-interacting galaxies. de
Vaucouleurs and de Vaucouleurs (1964) found that the KPG 578 is a
non-interacting pair with angular separation between galaxies 2.7
arcmin.
Heraudeau et al. (1996) found that KPG 578a has very faint bulge,
while the galaxy KPG 578b is the brighter member of a physical pair
with KPG 578a. The projected linear separation equals to 44 kpc at the
distance of 56Mpc with the Hubble constant = − −H 50 h km s Mpc0 50
1 1
(Sandage and Bedke, 1994). The KPG 578b is a peculiar galaxy in pair
with KPG 578a (Elfhag et al., 1996). It is nearly edge-on, with strong
asymmetry along semi-major axis (Heraudeau et al., 1996). The KPG
578b has no nucleus and a straight line of matter proceeds to west from
the center along the major axis (Curtis, 1918).
Our aim in this study is to investigate and determine the photo-
metric parameters for galaxy pairs KPG 578 a,b. The geometric para-
meters of interacting galaxies were determined in a previous study
(Mohamed and Reshetnikov, 2011, Mohamed et al., 2011, and
Reshetnikov and Mohamed, 2011).
We have adopted a numerical values in this study using
= − −H 70 h km s Mpc ,0 70
1 1 Ωm=0.3 and ΩΛ=0.7. The paper is or-
ganized as follows: observations, data reduction and photometric cali-
bration have been presented in Section 2. The results and discussions
have been described in Section 3. Finally, conclusions have been shown
in Section 4.
2. Observations, data reductions and photometric calibration
We observed the galaxy pair KPG 578a,b in 2014 June 24 - 26 in
three BVR bands. Using CCD camera EEV 42–40 (2 k× 2 k pixels) at
Newtonian Focus of the Kottamia telescope 188 cm, Egypt, see Table 2.
The overscan, bias and flat-field corrections of raw images are
calibrated using a code of IRAF package that has been developed by us.
We have used the algorithm of Pych (2004) to clean the Cosmic Rays
from all images.
The standard stars of Landolt (2009) have been used to calibrate the
instrumental magnitude. We have used the transformation equations to
convert the instrumental magnitudes (bvr) to standard magnitudes
(BVR).

The zero-points magnitudes areZPb, ZPv and ZPr in BVR bands. The
color terms are CTb, CTv and CTr in BVR bands. The extinction coeffi-
cients for the atmosphere are Kb, Kv and Kr in BVR bands. The air
masses are Xb, Xv and Xr in BVR bands.
We have measured the instrumental magnitudes of the standard
stars using the aperture photometry package of IRAF. We have de-
termined the best aperture to obtain the magnitude in BVR bands by
using curve-of-growth technique (Stetson, 1990).
Using Eqs. (1)–(3) we have determined the transformation coeffi-
cients. The zero-points magnitudes in BVR bands ZPb, ZPv and ZPr equal
to 19.934 ± 0.224, 21.726 ± 0.081 and 22.063 ± 0.039 respec-
tively. The color terms are CTb, CTv and CTr equal to 0.331 ± 0.027,
−0.027 ± 0.013 and −0.097 ± 0.012 respectively. The extinction
coefficients are Kb, Kv and Kr equal to 0.528 ± 0.153, 0.272 ± 0.053
and 0.130 ± 0.027 respectively.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Surface photometry and analysis
We have used the surface photometry technique of IRAF to measure
the photometric properties of each galaxy in the studied sample of
galaxy pair. The ELLIPSE task used the isophotes around the galaxies
from inner regions to outer regions. The ELLIPSE fitted the isophotes to
obtain ellipses. The outputs of photometric parameters of each ellipse
are the intensity, the total flux, the x and y center-shift, the ellipticity
and position angle. Using these outputs, we have obtained the lumin-
osity profiles, the x and y center-shift profiles, the ellipticity profiles
and position angle profiles. These profiles helped us to investigate the
galaxy pair KPG 578, i.e. this galaxy pair is interacting galaxy pair or
non-interacting galaxy pair. The interacting galaxy pairs appear dis-
torted and off-centering of the isophote in the outer regions (Ali, 1993;
Ali et al., 2015).
The photometric parameters have been measured within isophote at
semi-major axis (a) of 0.30 arcmin and 1.50 arcmin of galaxy KPG 578a
and galaxy KPG578b respectively, see Table 3. We have corrected the
magnitudes for internal-extinction (Schlafly and Finkbeiner, 2011). We
applied the k-correction using Chilingarian et al. (2010) and the cos-
mological dimming by subtracting 10 log (1+ z).
3.2. Morphologies and contour maps of galaxy pair KPG 578
The galaxy pair KPG 578 has been investigated using the visual
inspection in R-band of both the image and contour maps. This in-
vestigation was for KPG 578 in R-band using Kottamia observatory
(Fig. 1). Then we compared it with r-band of SDSS survey (Fig. 2) to
confirm the interaction signs. This galaxy pair contains two galaxies
KPG578a (NGC 5737) and KPG578b (NGC 7541). We have presented
the surface brightness of the outer isophotes and the interval between
them in Table 4. The major diameter of the main body of KPG 578a is
equals to d∼ 7.5 kpc (0.64 arcmin) at level 21mag/arcsec2, while
diameter of KPG 578b is equals to d∼ 7.3 kpc (0.62 arcmin) at level
19.8 mag/arcsec2. The contour maps in Fig. 1 show the existence of
asymmetric and non-concentric isophotes of galaxy KPG 578 indicating
new interaction signs.
3.3. geometrical parameters of tidal tails of galaxy pair KPG 578
Using visual inspection of the studied sample in Figs. 1 and 2, the
galaxy KPG 578a has one tidal tail in north-east from the center. The
geometrical parameters of tidal tail of this galaxy are the length
=l 6.9 kpct (0.59 arcmin), the thickness =h 1.5 kpct (0.12 arcmin) and
area = × =A h l 10.4 kpct t t
2of the tidal tail, see Table 5. This tidal tail
is curved line not straight line at north-east.
The KPG 578b has two tidal tails with curved lines. The first tail is at
east and the second at west from the center. The length of the first tidal
tail is =l 6.6 kpct (0.56 arcmin), its thickness is =h 1.0 kpct (0.09
arcmin) and its area is =A 6.6 kpct
2, while the second tidal tail has
length =l 11.2 kpct (0.96 arcmin), thickness =h 1.2 kpct (0.1 arcmin)
and area =A 13.4 kpct
2. Bridge et al. (2010) classified tidal tails into
long tidal tails ( >l dt ), medium tidal tails ( ≃l dt ) and short tidal tail
( <l dt ). According to this classification, KPG 578a has short tidal tail in
east from its center, while the first tidal tail of KPG578b is long tidal tail
in west and the second one is short tidal tail in east.
3.4. The projected separation, total orbital mass and total luminosity of
galaxy pair KPG 578
The projected separation between galaxies of the pair rp is calcu-
lated using formula of Karachentsev (1987).

Using Eqs. (4) and (5) we have obtained the projected separation of
the galaxy pair KPG 578 to be = −r 35.4 h kpcp 70
1 and relative
velocity =vΔ 15 km/s. Patton et al. (2011) classified galaxy pairs into
close pairs ( < −r 30 h kpcp 70
1 ), intermediate pairs ( < < −r30 55 h kpcp 70
1 )
and wide pairs ( < < −r55 80 h kpcp 70
1 ) with its relative
velocity < <v300 Δ 1200 km/s. According to this classification KPG 578
pair is intermediate pairs.
The calculated mean distance of the galaxy pair KPG 578 is
D=38.3Mpc (see Eq. (6)). Using Eq. (7) we have determined the total
orbital mass of the galaxy pair KPG 578 to be = ⊙M x M6. 03 10t
9 .
Using the absolute magnitude in R-band of the Sun M(R)=4.43 mag in
the Vega-mag system (Willmer, 2018), we have estimated the total lu-
minosity of the pair as = ⊙L x L4. 49 10t
10 (see Eq. (8)). The ratio of
total orbital mass to total luminosity of the galaxy pair was estimated to
be =M L 0.13t t M⊙/L⊙.
3.5. The surface brightness profiles of galaxy pair KPG 578
The surface brightness (SB) profile of the galaxy KPG 578a shows a
normal profile in BVR bands (Fig. 3a). In B-band, SB started to de-
creases from a=3″ to a= 18″, while in VR bands SB started to de-
crease from a=3″ to a= 48″, the inner regions are found at semi-
major a≤ 30″, while the outer regions are found within semi-major
a > 30″. The SB of the galaxy KPG 578b shows a peculiar structure and
peculiar feature profile (Fig. 3b). In B-band, SB started to increase
a= 3″–10″ then decreases from a > 10″ to a= 90.3″. In VR bands, SB
started to decrease a= 3″–10″. Then again decreases from a > 10″ to
a= 90.3″. The inner regions are found within a≤ 40″, while the outer
regions are found within a > 40″. One hump is found on the profile of
the galaxy KPG 578a in BVR bands at semi-major from a=3″ to semi-
major a= 8″, some humps in VR bands stared from a=25″ outward.

198
Some humps are found on the profile of the galaxy KPG 578b in BVR
bands from a=10″ to 60″.
3.6. The x and y center-shift profiles of galaxy pair KPG 578
The x and y center-shift (xc, yc) profiles of the galaxy KPG 578a in
BVR bands are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (c). The x and y center of the
outer isophotes of the galaxy KPG 578a are shifted toward the galaxy
KPG 578b, started from 30″ and 35″ respectively to 47″. The x and y
center-shift of the galaxy KPG 578b in BVR bands are shown in Fig. 4(b)
and (d). The x center of the outer isophotes of the galaxy KPG578b is
shifted away from galaxy KPG 578a, started from 40″ in B and 50″ in
VR bands respectively outward. The y center of outer isophotes of ga-
laxy KPG 578b is shifted toward galaxy KPG 578a in BVR bands, started
from 50″ outward. This confirms that both galaxies KPG 578a and KPG
578b have signs of interaction.
3.7. The ellipticity profiles of galaxy pair KPG 578
The ellipticity (Ellip) profile of the galaxy KPG 578a has been pre-
sented in Fig. 5(a). The ellipticity increases in both inner and outer
regions in BVR bands. The ellipticity profile of the galaxy KPG 578b has
been presented in Fig. 5(b). The ellipticity in the inner regions in BVR
bands increases. In the outer regions, the ellipticity decreases within
a=40″–64″, then increases from a > 64″ outward. The outer iso-
photes of galaxy KPG 578a and galaxy KPG 578b are more flat (i.e.
ellipticity values increase). This is due to the gravitational interaction
between the galaxies.
3.8. The position angle profiles of galaxy pair KPG 578
The position angle (PA) profiles of the galaxy KPG 578a in the BVR
bands have been shown in Fig. 6(a). The outer isophotes of the galaxy
KPG 578a in BVR bands (a > 30″) are fluctuated from a=30″ out-
ward. The position angle profiles of the galaxy KPG 578b in the BVR
bands are shown in Fig. 6(b). The outer isophotes of the galaxy KPG
578b in BVR bands (a > 40″) are twisted to south toward the tidal tail
of galaxy KPG 578a at north-east. This means that the KPG 578a at-
tracted the galaxy KPG 578b from side of its tidal tail at the east. The
twisted outer isophotes of KPG 578b confirm that the galaxy pair KPG
578 is an interacting system.
4. Conclusions
The gravitational interactions between the galaxies of galaxy pair
KPG 578 have been investigated using our method: contour maps,
surface brightness (SB) profiles, x and y center shift (xc, yc) profiles,
ellipticity (Ellip) profiles and position angle (PA) profiles. We have
confirmed that the galaxy pair KPG 578 is an interacting system. We
have found that galaxy KPG 578a has one tidal tail in the north-east
from the center with its length is =l 6.9 kpct , its thickness
=h 1.5 kpct and its area =A 10.4 kpct
2. The KPG 578b has two tidal
tails, one of them in east from the center with its length is =l 6.6 kpct ,
its thickness is =h 1.0 kpct and its area is =A 6.6 kpct
2, while second
tidal tail is in the west with its length is =l 11.2 kpct , its thickness is
=h 1.2 kpct and area is =A 13.4 kpct
2. Only one author noticed that
KPG 578b has a straight line of matter proceeds to west from the center
along the major axis (Curtis, 1918). This straight line of matter pro-
ceeds to west is tidal tail with curved line not a straight line. We

confirmed that the galaxy pair is an interacting system which is oppo-
site to what found by Karachentsev (1987) and de Vaucouleurs and de
Vaucouleurs (1964).
Using surface brightness profile, we have confirmed that the KPG
578b is a peculiar galaxy with peculiar features in a good agreement
with Elfhag et al. (1996). Also our results of contour maps show that
KPG 578b has asymmetry along the semi-major which agrees with
Heraudeau et al. (1996). Using PA profiles, we noticed that the KPG
578b is twisted to south toward KPG 578a.
Using classification of Patton et al. (2011) for galaxy pairs, the KPG
578 is classified intermediate pair with projected separation
= −r 35.4 h kpcp 70
1 and relative velocity =vΔ 15 km/s. By assuming that
galaxies in galaxy pairs are in a circular orbit relative to each other, the
total orbital mass of KPG 578 is = ×M 6.03 10t
9 Mʘ, while the total
orbital mass to the total luminosity is =M L 0.13t t Mʘ/Lʘ.
Karachentsev (1987) found that galaxy pairs are physical systems if
<M L 100t t Mʘ/Lʘ. So the KPG 578 is considered as physical systems.
