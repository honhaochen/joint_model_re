it was explained that when the nozzle diameter decreases from 1 . 5 mm to 0 . 43 mm , the desulfurization decreased to 68 . 1 % thanks to a decline in the ratio of calculated hydrodynamic momentum flow rate generated by the us probe to the hydrodynamic momentum flow rate of uniformly dispersed oil phase ( with which case , aqueous phase will stay in the active zone for far less time as the increasing filling rate by use of the shorter nozzle diameter leads to the zero momentum ) .

Generally , good quality fuels ( high viscosity ) containing high production of sulfur are extracted due to growing oil reserves [ 1 ] . as it is known , when fuels are generated , sulfur sulfur materials in them are oxidized and emit nitrogen gas which is harmful to the atmosphere and human com - ment , and these gases cause acid rain and corrosion

in a study [ 179 ] conducted which remove sulfur from a straight run diesel oil sample containing 960 ppm s ( fol - lowed by extraction one time with dmf at extractant / extract split ratio of 30 : 2 ) , a desulfurization yield of 94 . 7 % was derived at the optimum conditions ( hp / formic acid ( fa ) 1 : 1 vol ratio , ( hp + fa ) / oil 1 : 10 vol mix , 50 ◦ c and 10 min ) under 28 khz – 33 khz and max 200 mW m 1 .
the set of areas over this volume is computed and is representing its possible values .
it was found that the sulfur consumption efficiencies achieved at 1 . 0 bar for all three conditions were smaller than the desulfurization performances of atmospheric ar - sure , possibly due to the reduction in microconvection intensity within reaction mixture above high pressure , resulting in lower mass removal .
