The human gut microbiota starts to develop right after birth and becomes stable around 3 years of age,
when it starts to resemble the adult microbiota (Bokulich et al., 2016; Yatsunenko et al., 2012). Even though
it is possible to speak of the adult gut microbiota in general terms, the detailed microbiota profile is var-
iable in adults and will be unique for each individual (Turnbaugh et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2015). This can be
explained by the several factors that can influence the establishment and development of the gut micro-
biota (Azad et al., 2013; Bokulich et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2017).
One important factor that may influence the community structure of the microbiota is host genetics. Pre-
vious studies based on culturable bacteria and fingerprinting of the fecal 16S rRNA gene suggest that part
of the intestinal microbiota in adults is established very early on in the newborn’s development with consid-
erable heritability, since the gut microbiota of monozygotic (MZ) twins is more similar than the microbiota
of dizygotic (DZ) twins (Blekhman et al., 2015; Goodrich et al., 2014, 2016; Hansen et al., 2011; Zoetendal
et al., 2001). Genome-wide association analyses (GWASs) have provided a list of candidate genes or vari-
ants that may play roles in shaping the gut microbiota, such as the association between Bifidobacterium
and the lactase (LCT) gene variants (Goodrich et al., 2016). Another example is that the genus Akkermansia
was associated with a variant previously associated with body mass index (Davenport et al., 2015).
On the other hand, little is known with regard to the development and establishment of the microbiota in
infants, and twin studies may provide important information on microbiota heritability. One of the first
studies attempting to show this role found that pairs of infant MZ twins had more similarities in terms of
eubacteria than nontwins (Stewart et al., 2005). Later, another study (Stewart et al., 2013) showed that, in
a sample of preterm infants, genetically related infants have gut microbiomes that are more similar
when compared with unrelated infants. The authors also found out that the community structures of the
only set of triplets (twomonochorionic monoamniotic and one dichorionic) were similar for all three infants.
In 2015, Murphy et al. studied one set of dichorionic triplet children in order to analyze genetic factors in the
development and establishment of the intestinal microbiota. They collected the infants’ stools at four
different time points (1, 2, 3, and 12 months) (Murphy et al., 2015). The authors found evidence that MZs
were more similar than the DZs in alpha and beta diversities in the first 3 months, but they did not find
any differences in the 12th month. All these studies were based on 16S rRNA gene data. Another study
examined 10 pairs of Chinese twin children, whose ages ranged from 5 months to 6 years old (Zhou

et al., 2016). Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, the authors obtained a single sample from each in-
dividual, and they found that the gut microbiota is strongly influenced by age and that MZ pairs share more
microbial species than DZ pairs.
Although these studies have made contributions to our understanding of the role played by host genetics
on the gut microbiome development, they were limited by small sample sizes (Murphy et al., 2015; Stewart
et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2016), lack of long-term follow-up (Zhou et al., 2016), or analysis only of older infants
(Stewart et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2016).
With the aim to overcome part of these challenges in understanding the role of host genetics in the estab-
lishment and development of the gut microbiota in infants, we have obtained 111 feces samples from five
sets of dichorionic triplets collected longitudinally, over an age range that varies from 1 month to 3 years.
We have also applied state-of-the art computational pipelines to process 16S rRNA amplicon fragments.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore this collection design.
RESULTS
Datasets
We obtained five amplicon sequence datasets that we named A through E, representing a triplet set each.
Of a total of 111 samples (each individual at a given time point yields one sample), 12 were discarded
because one, two, or all three triplets in a triplet set were taking or took antibiotics within the previous
30 days. This resulted in 99 accepted samples (Table S1).
Sequencing results
Bacterial 16S amplicon sequencing of the samples yielded 22,101,869 reads combining all sequence data-
sets. After pre-processing, we obtained 6,672,051 reads with a length of 230 bp and minimum phred-like
quality value 20 for each base, resulting in an average of 61,394 reads per sample (Table S2). All samples
reached a plateau when rarefied, indicating sufficient sequencing depth (Figure S1). The reads were as-
signed to 4,168 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs).
For the next two subsections, we present results of this microbiome dataset as a whole, without taking into
consideration the existence of triplets. The goal is to determine to what extent these results follow compa-
rable results from the literature, so that we can ensure a good baseline for downstream analyses.
Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium were predominant throughout the sets
The ASVs were classified into 13 phyla (Table S3). The phyla with the highest relative abundances overall
were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia (Fig-
ure S2A). The families Lachnospiraceae and Enterobacteriaceaewere the only ones in the top ten taxa in all
sets in terms of relative abundance. The phylum Bacteroidetes was primarily represented by the genus Bac-
teroides, which had the highest relative abundance in almost all sets (14%–35%), except in set D, in which
the genus with the highest relative abundance was Escherichia/Shigella (22%). The phylum Actinobacteria
was primarily represented by genus Bifidobacterium, which had similar relative abundances in sets A (11%),
B (11%),D (14%), and E (11%). In setC, whose samples were collected at later time points compared with the
others (16, 19, 20, 21, and 22 months), this genus had lower relative abundance (2%) (Figure S2B). Taxo-
nomic classification at the species level resulted in 168 species represented by 1,496 ASVs (Table S4).
Bacteroidetes and Bacteroides relative abundance increases with time
The three most abundant phyla were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. Analyzing the relative
abundance of these phyla in a longitudinal manner in all sets, we found that the relative abundance of Fir-
micutes did not vary by much over time, while Proteobacteria decreased and Bacteroidetes increased (Fig-
ure 1A). At the genus level it is more difficult to discern trends in relative abundance, but it does seem that
the increase in abundance for the Bacteroidetes phylum is driven by an increase in Bacteroides (Figure 1B).
MZs are more similar in beta diversity but not in alpha diversity
The mean scores for MZs and DZs for the Faith and Shannon indices and observed ASVs were not signif-
icantly different (p > 0.05), i.e., these groups presented similar alpha diversities (Table 1).

When relative abundance and phylogenetic relationships were taken into account in beta diversity analysis,
we could not detect a difference between the MZs and their DZ co-twin as measured by the weighted Uni-
Frac distance (p = 0.3124 for 10,000 permutation tests of themean difference in all sets). On the other hand,
using unweighted UniFrac, we observed that MZs (MZ1 and MZ2 mean difference) are significantly more
similar to each other than to their DZ co-twin, both when number of samples per set was considered
and not considered (considering number of samples per set, p = 0.0168; not considering the number of
samples per set, p = 0.0221). We also observed highly significant similarities between MZs when only pres-
ence and absence were taken into account by the Jaccard method (not considering the number of samples
per set, p = 0.0009). The Bray-Curtis measure, in which abundance is taken into account but not phyloge-
netic relationships, also showed that MZs are significantly more similar to each other than to their DZ co-
twin (not considering the number of samples per set, p = 0.0016) (Table 1).
Next, we applied principal coordinate analysis using Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, and weighted and unweighted
UniFrac distance metrics in each set in order to explore group differences between the samples. We
observed clusterization of MZs at some time points in each set, mainly in unweighted UniFrac distance:
in set A, MZs are clustered at 7 and 36 months; in set B, at 9, 13, 14, and 18 months; in set C, at 19, 21,
and 22 months; in set D, at 9, 11, 13 and 18 months; and in set E, at 1, 6, 7, 9, and 11 months (Figure 2).
In this measure, up to four principal coordinates were necessary to explain at least 50% variance of all sam-
ples, which ranged from 52.2% to 68.6% throughout the sets.
MZs share more ASVs between them when compared with their DZ co-twin
We checked whether each pair of MZs hadmore ASVs in common between them than betweenMZs andDZ
co-twins (MZ1 and DZ or MZ2 and DZ). The fractions of ASVs shared only between MZs (MZ1 andMZ2) were
13%, 12%, 15%, 13%, and 12% of total ASVs in each set A, B, C, D, and E, respectively (Figure 3). In order to
check if those fractions are significantly larger than the fractions between MZ1 and DZ (8%, 11%, 12%, 10%,
and 11%, respectively) and MZ2 and DZ (7%, 9%, 8%, 8%, and 10%, respectively), we applied a multinomial
model in each set to compare the three fractions (Figure 3 and Table 2). The result is that only for setA there
is statistical significance with respect to both MZ1 and DZ and to MZ2 and DZ (Table 2). Most ASVs shared
exclusively between MZs throughout the sets were classified as Bifidobacterium (60 ASVs, 7%), Bacteroides
(52 ASVs, 6%), and Veillonella (50 ASVs, 6%) (Table S5).
Specific time points reveal similarities of ASV-sample associations between MZs
We undertook a correspondence analysis (CA) in each set to investigate the associations of the abun-
dance of ASVs with the samples. We normalized the samples on the principal coordinate based on rela-
tive abundances of ASVs and the ASVs themselves on standard coordinates. In sets A and E, the relative
abundance of ASVs resulted in groups of samples based on time points (p < 0.05 for Pearson’s chi-
square test). Overall, we noticed that samples of time points 9, 11, and 13 months formed a separate

group from the other time points in these two sets. Next, we examined those time points (9, 11, and
13 months) more closely in all sets, except for set C, for which these time points samples were not avail-
able. We performed CA on those time points in which the chi-square p-values were less than 0.05, and
since the sample size of the contingency tables were large (>450), we calculated the coefficient of con-
tingency that was greater than 0.99 in all sets (Figure 4). To check the contribution of each sample and
each ASV to the significance of association, we took the log2 of the likelihood ratio (for simplicity, we will
call it ‘‘ratio’’ only), i.e., observed values over expected values from chi square, and used it as an index.
Then, we compared the results between the triplets as follows: monozygotic twin 1 versus monozygotic
twin 2 (MZ1 versus MZ2); monozygotic twin 1 versus dizygotic co-twin (MZ1 versus DZ); monozygotic twin
2 versus dizygotic co-twin (MZ2 versus DZ) (Figure S4). We found that both MZ1 versus MZ2 and MZ1
versus DZ had more similar ratios in 34 of 111 ASVs tested, whereas MZ2 versus DZ were more similar
in 20 ASVs out of 111. There were ties in similarity in 23 ASVs between all three or two of the groups
compared. Eleven ASVs (3, 8, 18, 19, 31, 43, 44, 63, 64, 80, and 714) were present in all sets and at all
three time points. From these ASVs, MZ1 versus MZ2 were more similar in terms of ASVs 43 and 63;
MZ1 versus DZ in terms of ASVs 8, 18, 44, and 80; and MZ2 versus DZ in terms of ASVs 3 and 714. In terms
of ASV-19, MZ1 versus MZ2 and MZ1 versus DZ were equally more similar than MZ2 versus DZ, whereas in

statistical significance. Heritability (H2r) is defined by the proportion of phenotypic variance attributed to
additive genetic variance, calculated on the basis of zygosity between siblings. We could perform
heritability tests only at time points 9, 11, and 13 months, since these are the only time points where
we had a large enough sample size (n = 4: sets A, B, D, and E). Before the test was applied, we screened
the ASVs as follows: First, we kept only ASVs that were present in at least 50% of all samples following
criteria in the literature (Goodrich et al., 2014, 2016; Xie et al., 2016). Second, we kept ASVs that were
present in at least three sets and whose relative abundances were not equal to zero in DZs of each
set at each time point. This resulted in 20, 28, and 32 ASVs at time points 9, 11, and 13 months, respec-
tively. From these, we determined that at time point 9 months there were five ASVs with significant her-
itability values; at time point 11 months, there were seven; and at time point 13 months, there were ten
(Figure 5 and Table S6).
Among ASVs with significant heritability values, ASVs classified as Bacteroides were by far the most prev-
alent (six distinct ASVs, with ASV-1 present at all three time points in this analysis, the only one to do so). We
also highlight two ASVs classified as Veillonella (ASV-8 and ASV-63), which together have significant heri-
tabilities at all three time points.
Finally, we compared these results with the ones we obtained from the shared ASVs and with the MZ clus-
terizations obtained with the CA (Figure S5). The following ASVs came up in all three analyses: at time point
9 months, only ASV-1 (Bacteroides); at time point 11 months, five ASVs: ASV-21 and ASV-31 (both Clostri-
dium_XlVa), ASV-60 (Blautia), ASV-63 (Veillonella), and ASV-80 (Clostridium_sensu_stricto); and at time
point 13 months, three ASVs: ASV-1 (Bacteroides), ASV-18 (Escherichia/Shigella), and ASV-860
(Bacteroides).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the relationship between host genetics and gut microbiome profiles of five
sets of triplet babies whose ages ranged from 1 month to 3 years. We used 16S rRNA amplicons for this
analysis and mainly explored ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) to assess host genetics influence on the
development of the gut microbiome.
The overall microbiome profile of these sets showed that the five most abundant phyla were Firmicutes,
Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomocrobia (Figure S2). In a previous study of
Brazilian children aged between 1 and 3 years, the exact same phyla were found to be the most abundant
(Chew et al., 2020). The same five phyla are also listed as themost abundant in several other studies of infant
microbiomes (Azad et al., 2013; Bokulich et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2017; Yassour et al., 2016). These observa-
tions suggest that these phyla play an important role in gut microbiota, independent of the environment.
At the genus level, various studies (Hill et al., 2017; Mcgeachie et al., 2016; Stewart et al., 2018; Yassour
et al., 2016) have shown that Bacteroides bacteria are not abundant in the first weeks of life in babies
born by C-section, but their abundance starts to increase around the sixth month. This finding was repro-
duced here; we saw Bacteroides first increase at six months of age. Previous studies of Brazilian newborns
(Brandt et al., 2012; Taddei et al., 2014) found that Escherichia/Shigella had the highest relative abundance.
In the present study, we observed this only in set D; in the others, Bacteroides was the most abundant, with
Escherichia/Shigella the second most abundant genus.
Regarding ASV classification at the species level, we first point out that, in general, the V3/V4 region of the
16S gene of the rRNA does not have the resolution necessary to distinguish different species of the same
genus (Johnson et al., 2019). However, given that the human gut microbiome is well studied, we hypothe-
size that many of the species classifications given by SPINGO for this particular dataset should be accurate.
For example, one of the identified species is Bacteroides fragilis, and its presence in the human gut is well
documented (Wexler, 2007). We refrain, however, from providing a general analysis of the ASVs at the spe-
cies level given the uncertainty in these classifications.
In terms of phyla variation over time we observed that Firmicutes was more or less stable, whereas Proteo-
bacteria decreased in abundance and Bacteroidetes increased in abundance. The same trends have been
reported previously in European children born by C-section (Hill et al., 2017; Yassour et al., 2016). We also
observed that thegenusBifidobacterium hadoneof the highest relative abundances overall, an observation
similar to that made by Hill et al. (2017). The genera Escherichia andClostridium sensu stricto had high rela-
tive abundances in the first months but decreased before 2 years of age. These same findings have been
reported previously and positively associated with C-section delivery (Hesla et al., 2014; Hill et al., 2017).
These results and comparisons with the literature suggest that the microbiome composition and its varia-
tion in our sets of triplets replicate the findings for similar profile children fromWestern countries. This may
be explained at least in part by the fact that the diet of people inhabiting large urban centers in Brazil (such
as São Paulo) is generally similar to that of people in European cities (Santos and Conde, 2020). One
alternative explanation is that the establishment of the microbiota in infants is primarily determined by
the human genome, with the environment being a secondary factor.
In a longitudinal (1 to 12 months) previous study of one set of Irish dichorionic triplets (Murphy et al., 2015),
alpha diversity was higher in the DZ twins. However, in the present study, the comparison between the MZs

and their DZ co-twin did not show evidence for differences of alpha diversity between the triplets. On the
other hand, we observed that MZs were more similar to each other than to their DZ co-twin in all beta
diversity measures, except weighted UniFrac. Goodrich et al. (2016), who analyzed the microbiome of
2,731 individuals from the United Kingdom (MZ twin pairs and DZ twin pairs) with a mean age of 60 years,
and Murphy et al. (2015), who studied only one set of dichorionic infant triplets, have also reported more
beta diversity similarities in MZs calculated by unweighted UniFrac distance, but not by weighted UniFrac
distance. Here, we also found high significance (p = 0.0001 for 10,000 permutation tests) on ASVs
exclusively shared between MZs (Table 2). In addition, MZs were more similar on Bray-Curtis measures.
These results suggest that the species composition of microbiomes rather than their relative abundance
(which is taken into account in weighted Unifrac) is driving the observed MZ similarities.
Our observations support the hypothesis that two specific bacterial genera may be particularly susceptible
to host genetics: Bacteroides and Veillonella. Starting at time point 9 months, the genus Bacteroides
was the most abundant in four of five sets. Moreover, among ASVs presenting significant heritability values
(p% 0.05), more were classified as Bacteroides than as any other genus. Among ASVs shared only by MZs,
the most frequent genus classifications were Bacteroides and Veillonella, after Bifidobacterium (Table S5).
On the other hand, we did not observe that ASVs classified as Bacteroides presented more similarities
between the MZs in terms of ASV-sample associations when compared with ASVs classified as other

the samples can be evaluated by the angle between them formed from the origin and the distance of the ASVs from the origin. The further from the origin
and the smaller the angle, the stronger the association. In set A (A), MZs are all in the lower quadrants and DZs are in the upper quadrants. In set B (B),

genera. Previous reports (Goodrich et al., 2014, 2016; Singh et al., 2017; Turnbaugh et al., 2009) have shown
that gut bacteria of the genus Bacteroides are particularly sensitive to environmental factors. The evidence
here presented suggests that bacteria of this genus may also be susceptible to host genetics.
Our investigation of ASV abundances associated with MZ pairs by correspondence analysis and the
heritability of ASVs showed that Veillonella ASVs, represented by ASV-8 and ASV-63, presented significant
heritabilities (H2r > 0.50; p% 0.05), the former at time point 13 and the latter at time points 9 and 11months.
Their ratios were more similar in MZ pairs than in the DZ co-twin. In addition, these ASVs were also
exclusively shared between MZs (ASV-8 at 9 and 11 months; ASV-63 at 13 months). Veillonella was one
of the top three most abundant genera that had the most number (50) of ASVs that were exclusively shared
between the MZs in all sets of triplets. Previous reports on heritability of the human gut microbiome
showed that the genus Veillonella had high heritability in an adult population of Hutterites (Davenport
et al., 2015). In another gut microbiome study of adult Chinese (40–75 years old), the family Veillonellaceae
was reported to have high heritability and its abundance to be negatively associated with some diseases
predictable by host genetics (Xu et al., 2020). In a study of the oral microbiome of 485 Australian dizygotic
and monozygotic twins aged 5 to 11 years (Gomez et al., 2017), it was reported that Veillonella was one of
the most heritable taxa as well as one of the most dominant. A recent longitudinal study on baboons
demonstrated significant heritability in a large list of phenotypes based on 16S rRNA sequences, including
the genus Veillonella as a whole and some ASVs classified as belonging to this genus (Grieneisen et al.,
2021). The authors showed correlation between the heritability of traits in baboons and humans. This
body of literature and our own results suggest that members of the genus Veillonella in the gut may be
susceptible to host genetic influence, especially early in life.
Recent studies demonstrated some health benefits provided by Veillonella. V. atypica improves athletes’
performance by turning lactate into short-chain fatty acid propionate, which counteracts inflammation and

provides energy for the body (Scheiman et al., 2019). Veillonella parvulawas identified as a co-participant of
the innate immune system modulation by increasing IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a responses, which are
involved in the regulation of the inflammation process (van den Bogert et al., 2014). Thus, members of
the Veillonella genus seem to play an important role in human development.
Previous studies (Rothschild et al., 2018; Tabrett and Horton, 2020) have presented evidence that the
human gut microbiome composition is more influenced by the environment than by host genetics. In
the present study, we find evidence that host genetics does have a discernible influence. Taken together,
these findings suggest that the host genetic-gut microbiome interaction can be very dynamic, especially in
early life, when the microbiota is developing.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, our study is the first to conduct a descriptive analysis of the gut microbiome on five sets
of triplets and test heritability on four of them. Our findings revealed that there are some bacteria that, at
least at the sequence level, are affected by host genetics, such as Veillonella and Bacteroides. We
hypothesize that there is a limited time window during infant gut microbiota development when this effect
occurs. Since signals of genetic effects on the gut microbiome might be subtle and temporary, future
investigations should aim at obtaining additional data, including microbiota genome sequences and
gene and protein expression data.
Limitations of the study
The main limitations of this study are the relatively low number of triplet sets (five), the relative lack of
uniformity in shared time points between the triplet sets, and the low number of samples during the first
6 months. Future studies following the experimental design presented here should seek to increase these
numbers.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
We recruited triplet mothers with social media ads. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Biosciences Institute of the University of São Paulo through Plataforma Brazil under the number CAAE:
15291119.2.0000.5464, and all parents signed informed consent. In four of the five pregnancies, the babies
were the result of in vitro fertilization, where two embryos were implanted and one divided afterwards,
resulting in one pair of MZ twins and one DZ twin. All five sets of triplets were delivered by C-section. These
healthy dichorionic triplets were included in the study.
METHOD DETAILS
Biological material collection
We collected stool samples from each baby and their respective mothers for access to the intestinal
microbiota. We collected up to 30 g of feces monthly from diapers in universal DNA collector tubes
and/or preservative tubes Omnigene-Gut OMR-200 GenoTeck. After verification and identification, all
samples were aliquoted and stored at 80C until processing.
Questionnaires’ application
Weapplied questionnaires for clinical follow-up on amonthly basis. The questionnaires contained questions
about clinical state of the babies and their respective mothers observed in the period between collections,
such as occurrences of viral conditions, infections, diet and habits, in addition to information about devel-
opment and gestational and postpartum occurrences (weight, hospitalizations, use of antibiotics, etc.)
DNA extraction and quantification
We extracted the bacterial DNA using the commercial QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, UK). The
processing was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted bacterial
DNA was quantified by fluorimetric quantification using Qubit Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ireland) or
Quant-iT  PicoGreen  dsDNA (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ireland) and the absorbance in NanoDrop
ND-1000 Visible UV Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ireland). The bacterial DNA extracted
was analyzed for their degree of purity, based on the ratios 280 / 260nm and 260 / 230nm in NanoDrop
ND-1000 Visible UV Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Ireland). After quality checking, the
samples were stored in a freezer at 20C or 80C until used.
16S rRNA amplicon sequencing
The samples of bacterial DNA extracted and purified from the babies’ and mothers’ feces, positive for 16S
gene in conventional PCR, were sequenced on the Platforms MiSeqTM 2500 from Illumina. For the assem-
bly and preparation sequencing library, we used primers 341F (CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AG) and 806R
(GGACTA CHVGGG TAT CTA AT) – both of them with an adapter overhang - for V3 and V4 regions’ ampli-
fication of 16S gene. We normalized all samples and the pooling for 4nM, and the pooling was sequenced
at 12pM with 20% PhiX as Control also at 12pM with 500 cycles per run. The instructions and reagents lists
were obtained from the ‘‘16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol (Part #15044223
Rev. B)’’ provided by Illumina Inc.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We processed the forward 16S reads with QIIME2 2019.10 (Bolyen et al., 2019) filtering out the raw reads
whose Phred quality scores were lower than 20 with plugin quality-filter q-score (Bokulich et al., 2013).

We used Deblur (Amir et al., 2017) for amplicon sequence variant (ASV) assignment, truncating all reads at
length 230 bp. Generation of the phylogenetic tree was performed with plugin q2-phylogeny; multiple
alignments were generated with MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2002) and the tree was inferred with fasttree2 (Price
et al., 2010). We normalized the data by rarefying to 10,000 read sampling depth without replacement
before the diversity analysis. Alpha diversities (Shannon index, Faith diversity (Faith, 1992) and Observed
ASVs) were calculated within the pipeline QIIME2 with default settings, and beta diversity analyses (Jaccard
distance, Bray Curtis dissimilarity, weighted and unweighted UniFrac (Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Lozu-
pone et al., 2007)) were performed with the R package phyloseq version 1.36.0 (McMurdie and Holmes,
2013). Alpha rarefaction curves were obtained with 10 steps in ggrare. We used SPINGO version 11.2
(Allard et al., 2015) and RDP classifier version 2.12 (Wang et al., 2007) with at least 85% identity for
taxonomic classification, on RDP version 11.5 (Cole et al., 2014). We kept only those classifications that
presented the same results from both programs. Species-level classifications were obtained from SPINGO
only. Histograms for both Phyla and Genus relative abundance were created with the R package ggplot2
version 3.3.3 (Wickham, 2016) in the QIIME2 pipeline. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) was calculated
on the four beta diversity measures mentioned above with the R package phyloseq version 1.36.0 and
ellipses were calculated by ggforce:: geom_mark_ellipse.
We counted and identified ASVs in each member of the sets and descriptively compared common ASVs
between the groups of monozygotic twins and their dizygotic co-twins. Visualization of the common
ASVs was made with Venn diagrams using the R package VennDiagram version 1.6.17. In order to check
whether the fractions of ASVs in the Venn Diagramwere significantly larger inMZs, we applied the following
multinomial model:
p1set  p2setffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiðp1set + p2setÞ ðp1set  p2set
2Þp
Pn
i
piset
where p is the estimated probability of sharing ASVs between 1) MZ1 and MZ2, 2) MZ1 and DZ, 3) MZ2 and
DZ in each set, and
Pn
i
pi is the sum of all estimated probabilities in the Venn Diagram in the corresponding
set. Overlapping of 95% confidence intervals (Goodman method) for the probabilities of occurrence were
calculated with the function GM and p-values calculated with the function pchisq; both functions from
CoinMinD R package. We adopted alpha = 0.05.
Permutation tests on alpha and beta diversities were performed to check for statistical significance based
on alpha = 0.05. We used as models (y.m1-y.m2)-((y.m1-y.d)+(y.m2-y.d))/2 for alpha diversities and
(y.m1m2)-((y.m1d)+(ym2d))/2 for beta diversities, where y is the mean or the median of the values of the
measures (Shannon, Faith, Observed ASVs, Jaccard, Bray Curtis, weighted and unweighted UniFrac); m1
is the value of monozygotic twin 1;m2 is the value of the monozygotic twin 2; d is the value of the dizygotic
twin; m1m2 is the distance/dissimilarity between monozygotic twin 1 and monozygotic twin 2; m1d is the
distance/dissimilarity between monozygotic twin 1 and dizygotic twin; m2d is the distance/dissimilarity
between monozygotic twin 2 and dizygotic twin. The model calculates the differences between the groups
considering the relationship between monozygotic-monozygotic twins and monozygotic-dizygotic twins.
Since our sets are unbalanced, we also used the models set((y.m1 + y.m2)/2 - y.d) for alpha diversity and
set(ym1m2-(y.m1d + y.m2d)/2) for beta diversity, and calculated the mean or the median within the sets
and between sets to take into account the longitudinal profile by set, i.e. calculations were done per set.
Then, we permuted 10,000 times the original values of the groups m1, m2 and d (or m1m2, m1d, m2d)
and sampled with replacement. P-values were obtained by calculating the number of times the mean or
median from our models was present within the distribution generated by the permutations. In other
words, if the values from the models which considered the different relationships between the groups
(m1, m2, d) were rarely (0.05 or lower) present in a randomized distribution, we concluded that there
was a significant difference between the monozygotic and dizygotic groups.
Correspondence analysis (CA) in each set was performed in R studio. We used the absolute abundance of
ASVs present in each set to check for associations between the ASVs and the samples. First, we performed
the CA with the 50 most abundant ASVs in each set allowing for clear visualization on the graph and avoid-
ing overlap of variables that would make it difficult to read. We applied the function fviz_ca_biplot from the
R package factoextra (version 1.0.5) setting the map to rowprincipal which generates an asymmetric plot
with rows (samples) in the principal coordinates and columns (variables - ASVs) in standard coordinates,
i.e, samples with similar abundance cluster together and the variables that contribute to the clustering are
positioned in a low angle with the samples revealing their associations. Then, we computed Person’s chi
square test with simulated p-value based on 2,000 replicates to overcome the problem of very low
expected values or zeros on the dataset. Since the contingency tables of all sets had a large sample size
(N > 450 cells), we calculated the coefficient of contingency by:
C =
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
X2
X2 + N
r
We performed the CA again later with those 50 most abundant ASVs adding all the ASVs whose heritability
(explained below) was significant, regardless of their abundance. We selected time points 9, 11 and 13
where we noticed clusterization from previous CA and where the heritability tests were applied. Here,
we calculated the log2 likelihood ratio (ratio = observed value/expected value) as an index to interpret
the association between the samples and the ASVs (Figure S4).
Heritability tests were applied to sets A,B,D and E at time points 9, 11 and 13, and it was made by testing
H0: s
2
g = 0 against H1: s
2
g > 0 through the likelihood ratio statistic, which is asymptotically distributed as a
1/2:1/2 mixture of Chi-square with 0 and 1 degree of freedom. SOLAR (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage
Analysis Routines) Eclipse version software package version 8.5.1 (beta) (Kochunov et al., 2015) (http://
www.solar-eclipse-genetics.org/) was used for the test with default settings. SOLAR software applies vari-
ance component models under maximum likelihood estimation approach using the following matrix to
take into account family dependence among individuals:
U = 2Fs2
g + Is2
e
where omega U is the covariance matrix for a pedigree of individuals, F is the kinship matrix of pair-wise
kinship coefficient among all individuals, s2g is the genetic variance component due to additive genetic fac-
tors, I is the identity matrix, and s2e is the variance component due to specific environmental effects of each
individual, such that
H2r =
s2
g
s2
p
is the narrow sense heritability and s2p =s2g +s2e is the total phenotypic variance (Kochunov et al., 2015).
We first excluded from our analysis ASVs that were not present in 50% of samples of those sets at those time
points. Then, we filtered in, per time point, ASVs that were present in at least 3 sets and at least in one
monozygotic and dizygotic co-twin in each set. The phenotype file containing relative abundance re-
sponses was input into the software and normalized with inorm before the heritability test. Environmental
factors such as diet, antibiotic intake, diseases and milestones (crawling and walking) were registered for
each set of triplets, however, those variables could not be tested for heritability because there were very
few variabilities, that is, the babies presented very similar profiles within the sets and between the sets.
The phenotype sex was modelled as covariate in the adjusted models. Graph comparing heritability esti-
mates was generated in R package ggplot2.
