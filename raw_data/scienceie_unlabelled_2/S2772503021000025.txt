We examine to what extent mobile phones and the internet drive emigration to OECD countries. Using a panel 
of countries from 1990 to 2010 (when these technologies became more prevalent), we regress the stock of immi- 
grants in OECD countries from source country i on the percentage of i ’s population having access to the internet 
as well as the percentage of the population having mobile phones. We find that the internet dissuades migration 
from i to the OECD whereas mobile phones encourage it. We then consider to what extent these technologies 
substitute or complement other informational linkages by interacting each technology in source country i with 
the stock of prior immigrants in destination country j . We find substitution effects between these technologies 
and past migration. 
Numerous studies have considered push and pull factors affecting
igration. Mayda [23] , Hatton and Williamson [20] , Berthélemy et al.
8] , and Beine et al. [7] provide surveys of this literature. This paper
onsiders technological factors that could drive (push) emigration to
ECD countries, namely the degree of access to the internet and the
revalence of mobile phones in migrant-source countries. However, we
llow effects of these two technologies to differ, especially since our
ample runs from 1990 to 2010 and so before mobile phones became
smart phones ”. 
The internet could allow for greater information flows thereby facil-
tating migration. Completing online forms could also make migration
asier. In some cases, however, the internet could lower immigration as
eople can sell labor services without physically moving as in Agrawal
t al. [1] . Mobile phones provide another way for people to communi-
ate but, at least before 2010, were less useful at transmitting documents
r other large sources of information. They would allow people to re-
ain connected to family and friends staying in the source country but
ikely prove less beneficial for conducting business tasks offsite. 
We find examining the impact of these technologies on emigration
articularly interesting given their recent emergence. We consider these
ew technologies as changes in structural characteristics, ones that tran-
cend fluctuating business cycle conditions or sudden but temporary po-
itical upheavals. But unlike other persistent factors such as geography,
ulture, and language, the recent emergence of these technologies al-
ows one to exploit their increasing prevalence to examine how these
hanges have impacted emigration to OECD countries. Adoption of these∗ Corresponding author.

ore, our period of study, 1990 to 2010, provides an insightful window
o examine the effects of these technologies. When these technologies
ecome (nearly) ubiquitous in future periods, the lack of variation will
reclude examining their effects. 
In a similar paper, Winkler [33] finds that internet adoption is as-
ociated with less emigration to OECD countries. However, we extend
his analysis in two important ways. First, to what extent might other
ypes of technologies in communication such as mobile phones mirror
hese results? Our initial specification considers how internet accessibil-
ty and mobile phone prevalence are associated with greater emigration
o an OECD country regardless of the specific destination country. We
egress a measure of the total emigrants from country i in any OECD
ountry upon a measure of internet accessibility and a measure of mo-
ile phone prevalence in country i . This approach presumes that each of
hese technologies impacts migratory destination decisions uniformly
cross countries and so specifying a particular destination is not rele-
ant. 
A second specification allows us to examine another issue that Win-
ler [33] did not explore nor has anyone (to the best of our knowledge).
e consider to what extent these technologies could each substitute
or or complement other informational channels that make migration
asier. For example, suppose a large stock of immigrants from i live in
ountry j and so can provide a source of information about country j
egardless of whether inhabitants of i have internet access. If obtain-
ng information about j is the main benefit of the internet (with regard
o migration) then the effect of the internet on emigration from i to-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ )

1 Researchers have also examined other effects of cell phone adoption. Min 
et al. [25] examine how the greater prevalence of smart phones in rural China 
impacted decisions to work off the farm as well as diversify across crops. Sek- 
abira and Qaim [29] find that cell phone adoption contributes to greater in- 
come, female empowerment, and better nutrition in Uganda. Klonner and Nolan 
[22] find that the spread of cell phones increased employment in rural South 
Africa with greater effects for women. Aker et al. [4] and Aker and Ksoll 
[2] found that access to mobile phones test scores in Niger. 
2 Of note is that these studies more than a decade old mostly consider mobile 
phones before they became “smart ” phones providing easy access to the internet. 
3 Other studies also allow for separate effects from these two technologies 
although not on migration. Iqbal et al. [21] consider the effects of each on broad 
measures of “human development ”. Donou-Odonsou [17] considers their effects 
on economic growth in Africa. Shabbir et al. [30] examine effects on corruption.  should decline. On the other hand, perhaps the internet could com-
lement other sources of information. A larger existing stock of immi-
rants providing some information about a particular destination coun-
ry could then make it easier to focus subsequent queries. To explore
hether technologies like the internet and mobile phones substitute
r complement other information flows, the dependent variable is no
onger the total number of immigrants from i in OECD countries but the
umber of immigrants from i in country j . The dependent variable is now
ocation specific. The key right-hand side variables are the interactive
erms, TOTAL ij1990 
∗ INTERNET it and TOTAL ij1990 
∗ MOBILE it . INTERNET it 
 MOBILE it ) denotes a measure of internet accessibility (mobile phone
revalence) in country i at time t and TOTAL ij1990 denotes the total num-
er of immigrants in 1990 from source country i living in country j and
aptures, albeit imperfectly, the potential for one to gain and experience
amiliarity with destination country j . A positive coefficient on this inter-
ctive term would suggest that the technology complements these other
ources of information whereas a negative coefficient would suggest a
ubstitution effect. 
The specifications we use also allow effects to differ depending on the
ducation level of the emigrants. Presumably, those with less education
re more likely to be employed as manual laborers that need to work
nsite whereas those with more education can perform their duties from
 distance. To this extent, these technologies would have more negative
ffects on the emigration of higher educated individuals. However, the
nternet could also spur migration of all groups to the extent it facilitates
cquiring general information or applying for visas. One can again con-
ider these technologies complements or substitutes for other channels
f information. Presuming that those with higher levels of education are
ore knowledgeable about conditions and procedures in other coun-
ries, a more positive effect of these technologies for higher educated
ndividuals would suggest the internet complements these other sources
nd channels. If the impact of these technologies is more positive for
ower educated individuals, however, then such a result would suggest
hat these technologies are substituting for other sources of information.
Our results show that the internet dissuades migration from i to the
ECD whereas mobile phones encourage it. The internet does not affect
ow skilled migration from low and middle-income countries. However,
he magnitudes of the effects are not large, suggesting that telecommu-
ications technologies are not the main driving force of international
igration. We also find substitution effects between these technologies
nd past migration. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 pro-
ides a literature review. Section 3 describes the empirical methodology,
ncluding the data we use. Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 pro-
ides concluding discussion. 
. Literature review 
Several studies consider the internet’s various effects. Vu [32] , Choi
nd Hoon Yi [12] , and Czernich et al. [14] find that the internet in-
reases economic growth. Ackerman et al. [5] find that the internet
ncreases demand for skilled workers. Freund and Weinhold [19] re-
ort that the internet boosts trade. Choi [10 , 11] , Fink et al. [18] , and
arbero and Rodriguez-Crespo [6] consider how the internet promotes
rade. Choi [10] studies the effects of the internet on inward foreign di-
ect investment (FDI) using bilateral data, hypothesizing that internet
sage can lower search costs and improve transparency between coun-
ries. 
International migration provides another global link that could have
een influenced by the increasing use of the internet. Winkler [33] finds
hat higher internet penetration in source countries decreases emigra-
ion. More recent studies use survey data to study the impact of internet
se on migration plans. Pesando et al. [27] report that those who often
se the internet are more willing to migrate and have more seriously
onsidered doing so. Merisalo and Jauhiainen [24] report that social
edia usage affects asylum-related migrants’ location choices and mi-2 ration experience. One possible reason is that social media use could
orm a type of social tie with similar effects as diasporas [15] . 
In addition to international migration, other studies consider intra-
ational migration. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Cooke
nd Shuttleworth [13] report that the internet hindered interstate mi-
ration in the U.S. Vilhelmson and Thulin [31] surveyed young adults
n Sweden who often stated that considerations regarding the internet
ot only influenced the decision to move but also the destination. 
Of course, the internet is not the only technology that has contributed
o communication and the flow of information. The explosion of mo-
ile phones provides another potential determinant of migration. 1 Muto
26] finds that members of Ugandan households with cellphones were
ore likely to migrate from rural to urban areas. The effect was stronger
or ethnic minorities that might have had fewer connections away from
ome, providing evidence that the effect of mobile phones is stronger for
hose who are otherwise informationally disadvantaged. In this sense,
obile phones provide a substitute for other types of information gath-
ring. Aker et al. [3] also find that access to mobile phones increases
he probability of migrating. Schaub [28] reports that mobile phones
ncrease migration from Central Africa to Morocco. 2 
Our study differs in three important ways from those above. First, we
xamine the association between mobile phones and international migra-
ion as opposed to within-country-migration although Schaub [28] is an
xception. Second, we compare how each of these two technologies in-
uence emigration. 3 Adoption of the two technologies is correlated and
o not controlling for one when examining the effect of the other could
ias results. However, since these technologies are not perfect substi-
utes, effects need not be the same, either. In fact, the above discussion
nticipates such a result as past studies report a negative association
etween internet adoption and emigration while other studies find a
ositive association between mobile phone adoption and emigration.
f course, the magnitudes of these coefficients could still be skewed by
he omission of the other variable in the regression model. Finally, we
onsider to what extent these two technologies could substitute or com-
lement other linkages. For example, does the effect of these technolo-
ies become stronger or weaker when a large stock of immigrants from
he same source country already resides in the destination country? The
ack of immigrants already living in destination countries could serve as
n informational disadvantage for potential immigrants in the future.
o technologies like the internet and mobile phones help to overcome
hese disadvantages? 
. Empirical methodology 
.1. Econometric models 
Our first specification does not consider the particular destination of
migrants from country i as long as this destination is an OECD country.
he empirical model is: 
4 We use stocks of emigrants instead of flows due to greater data availability. 
5 An exception to using the IHS transformation is for POL since it is an ordinal 
variable. Instead, we re-normalize it so that it spans 0-1. 
6 Results are robust using the log transformation and are available upon re- 
quest.  𝑖,𝑡 ( 𝑠 ) = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛿𝑡 + 𝛽 ∗ 𝐼 𝑁 𝑇 𝐸𝑅𝑁 𝐸 𝑇 𝑖,𝑡 −5 + 𝜇 ∗ 𝑀 𝑂𝐵𝐼 𝐿 𝐸 𝑖𝑡 −5 
+ 𝛾 ∗ 𝑋 𝑖,𝑡 −5 + 𝜀 𝑖,𝑡 (1) 
here M it ( s ) denotes the stock of immigrants in OECD countries from
ountry i at time t of education level s . INTERNET denotes the fraction of
he population reporting access to the internet as described above. MO-
ILE denotes the fraction of the population having a mobile phone. The
atrix X denotes time-varying country-level characteristics that could
perate as push factors from country i . These controls include: GDP per
erson ( GDP ), total population ( POP ), the fraction of the population un-
er 45 years of age ( YOUNG ), an indicator of political rights ( POL ), and
he trade share ( TRADE ). GDP accounts for the level of economic de-
elopment. Not only does income influence the desire to emigrate but
ncome also matters for technological adoption. More populous coun-
ries can produce more emigrants and could also be a factor for the
revalence of the internet or mobile phones, especially since companies
roviding these services could target larger countries. Younger popu-
ations are more likely to adopt new technology as well as emigrate.
olitical rights could again influence the desire or ability to emigrate as
ell as matter for a government’s encouragement or even allowance of
ts citizens to use these technologies. Finally, TRADE controls for other
ypes of openness that could be associated with emigration. Time invari-
nt push factors are captured by the country fixed effect, 𝛼i . Because the
pecific destination of emigrants within the OECD is not relevant in this
rst examination, we do not include destination specific pull factors.
he time fixed effect, 𝛿t , captures global effects identically impacting
migration from all countries. 
A potential concern stems from the possible endogeneity of INTER-
ET and MOBILE . Ideally, one could instrument for them although we
o not do so given the difficulty of finding suitable instruments. Nev-
rtheless, the above specification takes several steps to diminish endo-
eneity concerns. For one, all right-hand-side variables are lagged one
ve-year period. Second, the inclusion of country fixed effects elimi-
ates the potential for time invariant factors to drive both emigration
nd the adoption of new technology. Finally, the inclusion of economic,
olitical, and demographic controls covers a wide array of factors that
ould drive both emigration and technological adoption. Nevertheless,
e acknowledge that endogeneity concerns remain and so results should
e tempered accordingly. 
Our second specification considers source-destination ( i-j ) bilateral
airs and so can examine to what extent internet accessibility in source
ountry i has differing effects depending on the country of destination j .
his specification can address whether these technologies complement
r substitute for other sources of informational linkages between i and
 . We consider the following model: 
𝑀 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 ( 𝑠 ) 𝑀 𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 ( 𝑠 ) = 𝜃𝑖,𝑡 + 𝜂𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜋𝑖,𝑗 
+ 𝜌 ∗ 𝑇 𝑜𝑡𝑎 𝑙 𝑖,𝑗, 1990 ∗ 𝐼 𝑁 𝑇 𝐸𝑅𝑁 𝐸 𝑇 𝑖,𝑡 
+ 𝜈 ∗ 𝑇 𝑜𝑡𝑎 𝑙 𝑖,𝑗, 1990 ∗ 𝑀 𝑂𝐵𝐼 𝐿 𝐸 𝑖,𝑡 + 𝛾 ∗ 𝑋 𝑖𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜎𝑖,𝑡 (2) 
here 𝜃i,t captures all push factors in source country i and time t , 𝜂j,t cap-
ures all pull factors in destination country j at time t , and 𝜋i,j captures
ll time-invariant characteristics linking i and j . Time-varying charac-
eristics are included in matrix X and will be discussed below. 
The key variables are the two interactive terms where Total i,j, 1990 
enotes the number of immigrants from source-country i in destination-
ountry j in 1990, the start of the sample period. We focus on a pre-
etermined stock of immigrants since this parsimoniously controls for
ther factors such as historical or cultural links between i and j that
nfluence migration from i to j . That is, we presume that the effects of
uch links can be captured by a measure of past migration from i to j .
oreover, the year 1990 mostly predates the internet and mobile phones
nd so this past migration from i to j is not driven by these technologies.
inally, a large stock of immigrants from i would likely provide a source
f information and network for future migrants. In summary, this initial
tock of immigration from i in j parsimoniously controls for many factors3 hat link i and j , that could matter for subsequent migration, and that
as not driven by the technologies we consider here. A positive 𝜌 implies
hat the internet complements this link thereby reinforcing connections
etween the two and promoting integration whereas a negative 𝜌 implies
hat the internet substitutes for this other link. The interpretation of 𝜈
s analogous. 
The advantage of the specification in (2) is that the 𝜃’s and 𝜂’s capture
ll country-level push and pull factors. These inclusions are especially
mportant to the extent that these technologies proxy for the degree of
conomic and social development that could also influence emigration.
.2. Data 
For migration, we take data from Brücker et al . [9] , hereafter re-
erred to as the IAB data ta from Docquier et al . [16] . IAB data in-
lude the stock of migrants who are 25 years of age and older, migrat-
ng from non-OECD countries to an OECD country (as the OECD was
onstituted in 2000) . 4 Migrant status is defined by birth country in-
tead of citizenship (whether one is ‘foreign born’.) IAB also provides
igration data based on educational attainment, classifying those with
rimary (completed less than upper-secondary education), secondary
completed upper-secondary education), and tertiary education (com-
leted a post-secondary education.). The IAB data begins in 1980 al-
hough we begin our sample in 1990 as public accessibility to the inter-
et was sparse during the 1980 ′ s. IAB data is not available annually but
n five-year increments. 
INTERNET it denotes the number of internet users per 100 people in
he migrants’ origin country in year t . The data was compiled by the
nternational Telecommunication Union made available by the World
ank. “Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from
ny location) in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a com-
uter, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital
V etc. ” MOBILE it represents mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 peo-
le in the migrants’ origin country in year t . The data measures “sub-
criptions to a public mobile telephone service that provide access to the
STN [public switched telephone network] using cellular technology ”
nd includes postpaid as well as prepaid accounts. Data on INTERNET it 
nd MOBILE it was compiled by the International Telecommunication
nion made available by the World Bank. 
Instead of taking natural logarithms of the migration variables, we
se the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) transformation since zeros com-
rise 17% of the bilateral migration data, M ijt . In order to be consistent,
he same transformation is used for the total migration variable, M it , in
1) as well as for the right-hand-side variables in (1) and (2) even when
o cases of a zero arise. 5 , 6 
Table 1 provides more specifics regarding data sources and Table 2
rovides summary statistics. 
. Results 
.1. Emigration aggregated across all OECD countries 
Table 3 presents two sets of results. For each set, we consider the total
umber of emigrants from country i living in any OECD country, the
umber of low skilled emigrants (primary education), and the number
f high skilled emigrants (tertiary education). The first set (columns 1–3)
onsiders all countries as source countries and the second set (columns
–6) considers only low and middle-income countries (as classified by
he World Bank) as source countries.

Several findings emerge. First, if mobile phones and the internet were
oth capturing the same general, underlying level of technology of the
ource country, then collinearity issues would prevent finding strong
esults. Instead, we find strong coefficients for both types of technol-
gy in columns (1) – (3). More importantly, the coefficients have op-
osite signs, coinciding with findings from the aforementioned studies
hat considered each technology separately. The prevalence of the in-
ernet is negatively associated with emigration from country i to an
ECD country whereas the prevalence of mobile phones is positively
ssociated. Such a finding could arise given that these technologies are
mperfect substitutes – again, even more so before 2010 – and so cap-
ure distinct aspects of technology. The positive coefficient for mobile
hones could indicate that the ability to stay in touch with family and
riends encourages people to emigrate. However, this finding with mo-
ile phones is stronger when considering all source countries versus only
ow and middle-income source countries. This finding suggests a greater
arginal impact of mobile phones in high-income source countries. This
ould arise given the greater similarity between high income source and
estination countries. With more similar characteristics, any difference
n the prevalence of mobile phones could have a greater marginal im-
act. 
More generally, results for both types of technologies are stronger
or the full set of countries than for those coming from low and middle-4 ncome countries. This is not surprising given that moving to an OECD
ountry from a poorer country could comprise greater overall benefits
and perhaps greater costs as well) than does migrating from one OECD
ountry to another. As before, the relative importance of access to var-
ous communication technologies in the source country in the decision
o migrate could be lower in a poor country where many characteristics
iffer between the low-income country and an OECD one. 
The smallest (in magnitude) coefficient in columns (4)–(6) is that on
NTERNET for low-educated emigrants. Such individuals are most likely
o sell manual labor when emigrating to an OECD country and so their
obs are less reliant on the internet. 
But even when statistically significant, coefficient magnitudes are
ot large. Consider a one-standard deviation increase in INTERNET
 − 1.7). With the coefficient on INTERNET of about -0.1, this increase
ssociates with a 0.17 decrease in TOTAL or roughly just 9% of a stan-
ard deviation of TOTAL . The analogous magnitude for mobile phones is
ust a 4.8% = (2 × 0.046/1.9) of a standard deviation increase in TOTAL .
lthough these technologies matter to some extent, they do not appear
o be the key driving forces of emigration, either. These small magni-
udes also coincide with previous findings. Winkler [33] found that a
0% increase in INTERNET leads to about 4.4% decrease in bilateral
igration stocks. 
Looking at the control variables, the coefficients on POL and POP
re not significant. This does not mean that political rights are unimpor-
ant. The inclusion of country fixed effects means that the coefficients on
he right-hand-side variables are driven by within-country variation. If
OL does not change much over time and POP changes at steady rates,
hen finding smaller coefficients on these variables is not surprising.
he negative coefficient on GDP indicates that fewer emigrate when in-
omes are rising. A country opening up as measured by trade sees more
migrants. Surprisingly, the coefficients on YOUNG for low and middle-
ncome countries is negative, suggesting that countries with younger
dults send fewer emigrants to OECD countries. 
.2. Emigration to specific OECD countries 
We now consider migration to specific OECD countries as cap-
ured in (2) and present results in Table 4 . Panel A includes no sepa-
ate time-varying controls except for the source-year and destination-
ear dummies. Panel B presents results for TOTAL 1990 
∗ INTERNET and
OTAL 1990 
∗ MOBILE when other interaction terms are included, namely
hen all the source country characteristics like GDP it in Table 3 are
lso interacted with TOTAL 1990 . Variables like GDP it are not included
eparately since they are captured by the i-t fixed effects. The inclu-
ion of these “extra ” interaction terms help ensure that the coefficients
n TOTAL 1990 
∗ INTERNET and TOTAL 1990 
∗ MOBILE are capturing how
n initial stock of immigrants in country influences the effects of these

technologies on further migration from i to j and not influences from re-
ated facets of development like income. We focus discussion on panel
Again, several findings arise. First, coefficients on both interaction
erms are negative. A large existing population of immigrants in the des-
ination country lowers the impact of these technologies on subsequent
migration. In this sense, this large pool of immigrants serves as a substi-
ute for these technologies either directly because existing immigrants
rovides a readily available network for one to access or because this
arge pool proxies for historical factors that already provided important
inks between i and j . 
Second, coefficient estimates are smaller in magnitude for mobile
hones, meaning less substitutability. A possible explanation is that the
nternet more strongly provides what a large pool of immigrants in the5 estination country could also provide, namely information and access.
onversely, consider mobile phones. When using a phone, one gener-
lly knows (or at least intends to contact) a specific person. One does
ot “surf ” for information. Having a large stock of compatriots in the
estination country might not lessen a desire to contact those at home.
n the other hand, if this large stock of compatriots allows for more
eneral information gathering and networking then it could be more
reatly substitutable with the services that the internet provides. 
Third, coefficient estimates for the internet interaction term decrease
lightly in magnitude when one restricts the sample to low and middle-
ncome countries. The same does not hold true for mobile phones where
oefficients slightly increase in magnitude. To the extent that social com-
unication is the primary benefit (again, before 2010) of mobile phones,
hat keeping in contact with people back home is more difficult for those

rom low-income countries, and that a large pool of compatriots makes
taying in touch with those back home less important – then the pres-
nce of prior migrants is more substitutable with mobile phones than
ith the internet. 
Finally, the coefficients for the mobile phone interaction term is
igher for highly educated emigrants than it is for those with low edu-
ation. To the extent that highly educated are more able to bring loved-
nes with them or return home to visit, then the degree of substitutabil-
ty between mobile phones and the stock of immigrants in the destina-
ion country should matter less.
Our sample period provides a unique opportunity to examine to what
xtent two (now) prevalent technologies impact emigration. Both the
nternet and mobile phones allow for greater degrees of communica-
ion and information transfer than ever before. Our findings suggest that
obile phones increase emigration to OECD countries, presumably be-
ause the ability to leave home while remaining in close contact with
hose back home encourages people to emigrate. However, the magni-
udes are not estimated to be large. The increasing prevalence of mobile
hones does not appear to be a large cause of brain drain. The internet,
n the other hand, discourages emigration. A priori, this result is not
bvious. The internet can be used to gain information, process applica-
ions, find employment, and also remain in contact back home. Offset-
ing effects include the ability to do work remotely and so remain in
ne’s home country while still selling labor services abroad. Our find-
ngs suggest that this latter effect dominates although the magnitudes
re, once again, not large. They are even smaller for low and middle-
ncome countries, again suggesting that the growth of these technologies
s not a driving force for emigration. Such findings lessen concerns of
rain drain from a policy making perspective. Taken together, our re-
ults imply that the impacts of technological change that one might see
s greatly similar could still have different effects on migration. 
The second part of the analysis considers to what extent these tech-
ologies could complement or substitute for other types of networking
r ways to gain information. The influence of these technologies is more
egative (less strong) in cases where a large stock of immigrants from
ne’s own country resides. As people from various countries intermix
n potential destination countries, then the effects of these technolo-
ies curtail subsequent emigration. If (due perhaps to political tensions)
igration flows diminish, then the impact of these technologies on emi-
ration would increase. In both cases, the impacts of these technologies
o not arise in a vacuum but depend on pre-existing migration stocks,
mplying that these effects are influenced by the historical and cultural
inks that have affected past migration patterns. 
However, further work is warranted. No instruments were used and
o endogeneity concerns persist. A second avenue would more closely
xamine what attributes about these technologies are most important
lthough disentangling effects from separate attributes is also problem-
tic. Finally, as data become more available, researchers also need to
xamine the usage of social media impacting global migration on a large
cale. More generally, future research needs to re-evaluate the relation-
hips between telecommunications technologies and migration as inno-
ation evolves.
