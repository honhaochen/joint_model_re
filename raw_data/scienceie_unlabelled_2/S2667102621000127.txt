Objective The study aimed to develop a machine learning (ML)-coupled interpretable radiomics signature to 
predict the pathological status of non-palpable suspicious breast microcalcifications (MCs). 
Methods We enrolled 463 digital mammographical view images from 260 consecutive patients detected with 
non-palpable MCs and BI-RADS scored at 4 (training cohort, n = 428; independent testing cohort, n = 35) in the 
First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between September 2010 and January 2019. Subsequently, 
837 textures and 9 shape features were subsequently extracted from each view and finally selected by an XGBoost- 
embedded recursive feature elimination technique (RFE), followed by four machine learning-based classifiers to 
build the radiomics signature. 
Results Ten radiomic features constituted a malignancy-related signature for breast MCs as logistic regression 
(LR) and support vector machine (SVM) yielded better positive predictive value (PPV)/sensitivity (SE), 0.904 
(95% CI, 0.865‚Äì0.949)/0.946 (95% CI, 0.929‚Äì0.977) and 0.891 (95% CI, 0.822‚Äì0.939)/0.939 (95% CI, 0.907‚Äì
0.973) respectively, outperforming their negative predictive value (NPV)/specificity (SP) from 10-fold cross- 
validation (10FCV) of the training cohort. The optimal prognostic model was obtained by SVM with an area 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.906 (95% CI, 0.834‚Äì0.969) and accuracy (ACC) 0.787 (95% CI, 0.680‚Äì0.855) from 
10FCV against AUC 0.810 (95% CI, 0.760‚Äì0.960) and ACC 0.800 from the testing cohort. 
Conclusion The proposed radiomics signature dependens on a set of ML-based advanced computational algo- 
rithms and is expected to identify pathologically cancerous cases from mammographically undecipherable MCs 
and thus offer prospective clinical diagnostic guidance. 
Breast cancer screening is widely recognized as the most effective
ay to improve the rate of early diagnosis, survival rate and quality of
ife of breast cancer patients [1] . Digital Mammography (DM) proves
uperior to other breast screening methods, e.g., breast magnetic reso-
ance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, for the detection of breast MCs,
urther allowing radiologists to scrutinize possible invasive ductal car-
inoma in situ (DCIS) [2‚Äì5] . Mammographic abnormalities radiologi-
ally scored at 4 according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data
ystem (BI-RADS) Atlas [6] are considered highly suspicious for malig-‚àó Corresponding authors: Yang Chen, The Laboratory of Image Science and Techno

onfirms the ultimate results as noncancerous or cancerous for further
urgical or noninvasive strategy making. However, real clinical statistics
eveal only approximately 35% cancerous MCs calling for mastectomy
f all the biopsied samples [7] . To raise diagnostic accuracy rate in ra-
iology and to reduce unnecessary biopsies, radiomics for interpretable
eature analysis concerning breast MCs is thus in the ascendant. 
Radiomics provides prospect for precise diagnosis in clinical oncol-
gy studies through the quantitative enhancement of medical imaging
epositories that depend on advanced mathematical analysis and ar-
ificial intelligence techniques [8‚Äì9] . Although the present radiomicslogy,
cheme is in the paradigm shift to a symbiosis of handcrafted features
ased on image intensity, shape, or texture and deep features gener-
ted by various deep learning networks, the latter presents a surplus of
omputer science automation and thus undermines its decipherability in
linical diagnosis [10‚Äì14] . As noted by Afshar et al. [15] , four main pro-
essing tasks, i.e., image acquisition, segmentation, feature extraction
nd statistical analysis with model building constitute the conventional
adiomics pipeline for handcrafted features. Specifically, handcrafted
eatures are able to represent local statistical properties established on
ixel intensity, e.g., energy, entropy and gray-level co-occurrence matrix
GLCM), from the transformative image derived by wavelet decomposi-
ion or by multiscale operators such as the Laplacian of Gaussian filter
LoG) and the Local Binary Pattern technique (LBP) [16‚Äì18] . Generally,
ll the studies reported in medical literature employed a broad range
f machine learning techniques such as KNN [19] , AdaBoost [20] , and
aussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) [21] . 
In this study, we generated a radiomics discriminative signature us-
ng machine learning techniques as the data miner to analyze its de-
erminability between noncancerous and cancerous cases measured by
PV/SP and PPV/SE to reduce dispensable biopsy and supplement fur-
her analysis of malignant calcification with radiological imaging knowl-
dge as reference for clinical use. 
. Methods 
.1. Patients 
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Ethics
ommittee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical Univer-
ity. Informed consent was signed and obtained from patients before
iopsy or surgery. Furthermore, our study was also in compliance with
he Helsinki declaration. 
We considered patients who presented to the First Affiliated Hospital
f Nanjing Medical University between September 2010 and January
019. In the study, 260 patients with MCs (mean age 47 years; range
0‚Äì85 years) were recruited for investigation, who were diagnosed by
ore needle biopsy. Among them, 130 (50%) cases were diagnosed as
alignant and others (50%) as benign by definitive surgery pathology. 
All patients met the following criteria: (1) with MCs detected and BI-
ADS scored at 4; (2) undergoing surgical biopsy with mammographic
uidance; (3) microcalcifications were confirmed to be successfully ex-
ised by X-Ray photography; and (4) pathological result as gold stan-
ard. Patients who had the history of any therapy for breast lesions
efore mammography were excluded. igure 1. Multiple lesions of MCs presented in a left craniocaudal (LCC) view 
mage (a) and its ROI (b) pathologically diagnosed as malignant and its manually 
nnotated mask (c). 
96 .2. Data acquisition and annotation 
All patients involved underwent digital mammographic examination
f the breast on a full-field digital mammography unit (Selenia, Ho-
ogic, USA). Two expert radiologists who were blinded to the pathology
esults independently examined mammograms and categorized MCs ac-
ording to morphology and distribution descriptors at screening. The tis-
ue blocks were reviewed and discussed by radiologists and pathologists
uring the consultation after biopsies. They would discuss and make
onsensus in case of disagreement. Following that, the results were sent
o locate and select regions of interest (ROIs) in the Digital Imaging and
ommunications in Medicine (DICOM) images with bounding boxes. 
To analyze the corresponding computational shape features of ROIs,
egional masks representing MCs distributional information had to be
anually segmented by a radiologist with 10 years of experience and is
isplayed in Figure 1 c, owing to its relevance to the possible malignancy
s defined in the latest BI-RADS Atlas Fifth Edition [6] . 
.3. Radiomics feature extraction 
Based on the original DM and its corresponding ROI mask integrated
ith another three categories of graphical transform operators at mul-
iple scales as derivative image types, shape features, intensity-based
tatistics and interpixel relationships were accordingly calculated. All
mage analysis development work was performed within Python 3.7.3
sing the PyRadiomics package. 
.3.1. Shape indicators 
Nine of the two-dimensional shape features (Shape2D) exhibited in
he last row of Table 1 , i.e., elongation, major axis length, maximum
iameter, mesh surface, minor axis length, perimeter, perimeter surface
atio, pixel surface and sphericity, were served as distributional descrip-
ors of breast MCs and were only calculated on the nonderived image
nd mask for the sake of its independency from graylevel intensity dis-
ribution. Definitions of each aforementioned shape metrics e.g., elon-
ation, can be found in [22] . 
.3.2. Image transformation 
To combine intensity properties and textures on various hierarchi-
al scales, three universally used texture operators, i.e., Laplacian of
aussian (LoG) spatial filters ( ùúé = 1 , 2 , 3 ), single level coiflet decompo-
ition and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm in its uniform pattern
ere applied to the original DM image, respectively, before following
he texture extraction. 
.3.3. Intensity-based and interpixel relationships 
With regard to texture analysis, we investigated 18 first-order sta-
istical features representing intensity properties, 24 gray-level co-
ccurrence matrix (GLCM) features, 16 gray-level size zone matrix
GLSZM) features, 16 gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM) features,
 neighboring gray tone difference matrix (NGTDM) features and 14
ray-level dependence matrix (GLDM) features representing interpixel
elationships, as defined in [22] and also stated in Table 1 . A total of 93
etrics were employed on the aforementioned three derivative image
ypes and the original one. Ultimately, all the six classes of radiomics
extures amounting to 837 for each of the view images were extracted
n four different image types, including an original image and derived
mages of the other three types in question, i.e., LoG filtered, wavelet
ransformed, and LBP operated. 
.4. Radiomics signature building 
The yielded textural and shape radiomic features were scaled by Z-
core standardization for preprocessing to render into the standard nor-
al distribution. Next, three feature selection methods were applied suc-
essively on the preprocessed features for signature construction. Firstly,

However, Figure 2
evealed that ANOVA-selected candidates still intertwined in certain lin-
arity. Therefore, Pearson redundancy-based filter (PRBF) [23] was per-
ormed on the rest of the features to statistically drop out linearly de-
endent features from the feature space ( Figure 2 ). Subsequently, ordi-
ary least squares (OLS) [24] , a backward elimination algorithm that
stablished a linear regression model for the estimation of each fea-
ure variable‚Äôs weight further crossed off those less important candi-
ates. Following that, the final feature importance ranking was gener-
ted through the retrospective algorithm, i.e., XGBoost-embedded RFE
25] , to gain insights into clinical interpretability. The importance met-
ic was set as ‚Äòweight‚Äô, namely the percentage representing the relative
umber of times a particular feature occurs in the boosted trees of the
odel. 
After obtaining the 10 top-ranking features, four machine learning-
ased algorithms, i.e., LR, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
nd K-nearest neighbors (KNN), were performed to classify our clinical
M dataset. As for SVM, Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) was set97 s the kernel function. The other key parameters such as C/gamma in
VM and solver/tolerance in LR were cherry-picked by grid search. 
.5. Validation of the radiomics signature model 
During training, validation and testing, we considered views, i.e.,
raniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO), as individuals for
ure imaging research of DMs. However, predictive outputs derived
rom multiple views for the same patient were supposed to be combined
hrough voting for the final diagnostic result in clinical practice. Thus,
he prognostic performance of the above signature models was eval-
ated using 10FCV method and also the independent testing set. The
o-called independent indicates that different views of the same breast
ere not involved in both training set and testing set simultaneously.
nstead, this situation could possibly happen during 10FCV in light of
egarding each view as a single study object. 
The overall quality of classifiers in question was quantified by AUC
cores and ACC, with its diagnostic ability for noncancerous MCs as-
essed by NPV/SP and cancerous PPV/SE.

he significance of the parameters fitted by its linear regression model. 
With respect to AUC analysis, MannWhitney statistics was used as an
stimator of AUC, around which the 95% confidence interval (CI) was
btained by the Delong test. Youden‚Äôs index was thereby calculated to
nd the optimal cut-point, so was the confusion matrix to produce ACC,
PV/SE and NPV/SP. 
The mentioned statistical techniques were all practiced based on the

.1. Feature selection 
Preliminarily, 837 textures and 9 shapes were extracted from each
iew in our clinical non-public training cohort. Posterior to Z-score and
issing/invalid data handling, 805 features were trimmed by the one-
ay Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) F-test, yielding 426 candidates with
heir P values less than 0.05 as in Figure 4 . PRBF was then implemented
ithin the above candidates to shrink linearity in the feature set. The
ptimal set containing 10 textures, as given in Figure 5 displaying their
mportance ranking, was ultimately derived by RFE. Moreover, it was
lso expected for all the selected features to significantly differ between
he two categories of benign and malignant ( P < 0.05). 99 .2. Radiomics signature 
As presented in Figure 6 , larger ‚Äúwavelet-HH_ngtdm_Busyness ‚Äù
nd ‚Äúwavelet-LH_firstorder_Maximum ‚Äù, indicating more rapid changes
etween pixels on the coiflet transformed image, were found in the
alignant cases than those in the benign cases, so were ‚Äúlbp-2D_glrlm_

-mm-3D_glszm_ZoneEntropy ‚Äù and ‚Äúlog-sigma-1-mm-3D_firstorder_
ean ‚Äù which implied higher heterogeneity or disorder in the texture
atterns for the malignant. However, ‚Äúwavelet-HH_glcm_Imc2 ‚Äù and
log-sigma-3-mm-3D_firstorder_Uniformity ‚Äù were higher in the benign
roup, lending support to the assumption that the noncancerous
Cs exhibited higher textural uniformity under the corresponding

3. Validation and prognosis 
To acquire in-depth knowledge about the clinical implication of the
elected 10 radiomics features, we investigated six metrics, i.e., PPV/SE,
PV/SP, ACC and AUC, derived from 10FCV and on the testing cohort,
s summarized in Table 2 . Performance of KNN and of GaussianNB is
enerally inferior to that of LR and of SVM from 10FCV. As a result,
hey were dismissed in the testing evaluation of ACC. Furthermore, the
eveloped radiomics signature was considered to be more related to
he prediction of cancerous lesions based on the higher and more sta-
le PPV/SE scores from both LR and SVM, specifically achieving 0.904
95% CI, 0.865‚Äì0.949)/0.946 (95% CI, 0.929‚Äì0.977) and 0.891 (95%
I, 0.822‚Äì0.939)/0.939 (95% CI, 0.907‚Äì0.973) respectively for valida-
ion, as observed in Figure 7 . Alongside the confusion matrix-related
etrics, the AUC scores of the proposed prognostic models were also
nalyzed as in Figure 8 for validation and in Figure 9 a for testing. 
. Discussion 
In this study, we developed an ML-aided radiomics signature to pre-
ict microcalcifications as cancerous or noncancerous and found 10 in-
erpretable textures as malignancy-related. It demonstrated a moder-
te prognostic performance for non-palpable MCs status in our clinical
ataset, presenting possibility to provide clinical guidance in pertinent
herapy. 100 For the signature construction, 837 textures and 9 shapes serving as
eature candidates were trimmed to the 10 most contributive, among
hich GLCM-associated characteristics following the coiflet transfor-
ation and first-order statistics succeeding to the LoG spatial filtering,
.g., ‚Äúwavelet-HH_glcm_Imc2 ‚Äù, ‚Äúlog-sigma-3-mm-3D_firstorder_Energy ‚Äù
nd ‚Äúlog-sigma-1-mm-3D_firstorder_Mean ‚Äù, dictated the discriminabil-
ty of the classification model. More specifically, the selected radiomics
eatures translated properties such as heterogeneity, uniformity and dis-
rder of mammographic MCs into computable values. It is also worth
oticing that all the shape indicators were excluded by the OLS - because

ant difference between their benign and malignant groups in ANOVA
 P < 0.05) as presented by Figure 10 . This obscurity is also demon-
trated in Figure 3 as the first three shape2d-related features yielded
 values in t -test greater than 0.05. As to the classification, varied ma-
hine learning-based methods also influenced the final result. In our
resent study, LR and SVM proved to be more robust with higher prog-
ostic AUC, generally outclassing KNN and GaussianNB as reported in
able 2 . 
Table 3 compares the overall performance from the corresponding
ross validation of previous benchmark radiomics studies on the breast
ancer classification with that of our study. Notably, only Chen et al.
26] among the benchmarks in question had the BI-RADS category of101 heir image dataset clearly stated. The majority of existing radiomics
tudies performed their predictive model on medical image cohorts
hroughout BI-RADS categories 2‚Äì5, which decentralized the discrim-
native target to some extent owing to the visible deference between
amples at BI-RADS 2‚Äì3 and those at BI-RADS 5. In contrast to previ-
us studies, our radiomics signature model exhibits certain competence
y tan AUC score of 0.906 and handled a more challenging task, par-
icularly in regard to pure mammographic microcalcifications that are
uspicious for or highly suggestive of malignancy, namely with BI-RADS
qual to 4. 
There are some drawbacks and limitations in our project that require
odifications. Figure 11 displays four misclassified samples from ROIs
athologically confirmed as benign and malignant respectively. Despite
heir inappreciable distinction, possible causes and further suggestions

Firstly, it was labor-consuming and clinician-
ependent to manually annotate the ROI areas as we carried out in the
tudy, thereafter calling for the prospective auto-detection techniques
n the fine morphology and distribution of MCs. Secondly, the absence
f shape signatures was at variance with empirical knowledge from ra-
iologists, implying that more morphological statistics should be sup-
lementally scrutinized. Thirdly, PRBF performed in this study was not
ompetent enough to take more correlation other than linearity into
onsideration during redundancy elimination requiring more elaborated
tudy on other non-linear relationship. Finally, considering that the AUC
as down from 0.906 (95% CI, 0.834‚Äì0.969) to 0.810 (95% CI, 0.760‚Äì
.960) with the participation of our independent dataset, large-scale
uture cases from more centers should be enrolled to further evaluate
nd adjust our model. 
In conclusion, our study extracted radiomics features depicting
he distributional characteristics of breast MCs followed by XGBoost-
mbedded RFE as feature selection to constitute a predictive radiomics
ignature and to achieve moderate performance. Besides, the studied
nterpretable textural signature more or less disclosed some underlying
elevance to malignant lesions as reported by our probe into their per-
ormance of PPV/SE and NPV/SP.
