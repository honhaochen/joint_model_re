Among the emerging research topics, photocatalysis has been
influential and popular due to its promisingmulti-adaptation in the
energy and environment fields. Numerous visible light-induced
photocatalysts, such as SnO2, CdS, WO3, MoS2, WS2, and graphitic
carbon nitride (g-C3N4), have been investigated to promote pho-
tocatalytic activities. Among them, g-C3N4, a famous metal-free
polymeric semiconductor catalyst, is the most preferred because
of its beneficial properties, including high physical and chemical
stability, moderate bandgap energy (2.7 eV), and distinct electronic
structure [1]. However, g-C3N4 insufficiently utilizes light, has a
limited surface area, and yields a quick photoexcited electronehole
recombination rate, so it is limited by its poor photocatalytic ability
[2]. To address these weaknesses, researchers applied some critical
scientific solutions, such as element doping into g-C3N4 [3] and
preparing g-C3N4 composites with other semiconductors (metal
sulfide [4], metallic oxide [5], and graphene category [6]).onal University, Hanoi.

d/4.0/).Tin disulfide (SnS2) is a transition metal dichalcogenide semi-
conductor with a conventional two-dimensional (2D) layered
structure; it has been extensively investigated because of its low
price, nontoxicity, and unique physicochemical characteristics [1,7].
It also has a narrow bandgap of 1.89e2.35 eV, which provides a
relatively strong visible light absorption ability [8]. However, single
SnS2 is limited by the severe recombination of photoexcited car-
riers, thereby impeding its widespread application in photo-
catalytic processes. To overcome this problem, researchers
developedmany SnS2 modificationmethods; for example, coupling
SnS2 and g-C3N4 for constructing heterojunction photocatalysts is
an efficient strategy to promote charge separation based on the
photosynergistic effect and unique structural superiority [7,9,10].
To our knowledge, SnS2/g-C3N4 composites have been designed
and constructed using several methods, including ultrasonic
dispersion [9], in situ hydrothermal method [8], and wet precipi-
tation [7]. However, these synthesis routes are relatively complex,
costly, and time-consuming. As such, a green, cost-effective, and
convenient strategy for creating novel SnS2/g-C3N4 heterojunctions
with excellent performance is highly desirable. In this study, a new
synthesis of SnS2/g-C3N4 composites was developed using a one-
pot calcination process in air atmosphere from a reaction mixture
of tin (IV) chloride and thiourea. During the synthesis, g-C3N4 acted
as a buffer to exfoliate SnS2, whereas SnS2 speeds up theNational University, Hanoi. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND

deficiency form with improved charge transport. The photo-
catalytic activities of the obtained materials were examined by the
degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye under visible-light irradi-
ation. Although RhB is widely applied for many industrial appli-
cations such as textiles, paper, and food, it has high toxicity and
chemical stability, making it difficult to completely decompose by
the traditional biochemical and physical-chemical methods [11].
This work proposes a promising strategy of employing SnS2/g-C3N4
photocatalysts to eliminate RhB organic pollutant from dye-
containing wastewater.
2. Experimental
2.1. Photocatalyst synthesis
SnS2/g-C3N4 composites were fabricated via a simple calcination
method from a precursor mixture of tin (IV) chloride (SnCl4$2H2O,
99%, Merck, Germany), and thiourea (CH4N2S, 99.5%, Merck,
Germany). In a typical process, a mixture containing different
weight ratios of tin (IV) chloride to thiourea (1:25, 1:30, and 1:35)
was heated to 500 C for 4 h. The obtained samples were labeled
SCNx, where x ¼ 25, 30, and 35, corresponding to the weight ratios
of tin (IV) chloride to thiourea of 1:25, 1:30, and 1:35.
Pure SnS2 (labeled SNS) was synthesized through the post-
calcination of SCN30 at 650 C in Ar gas for 2 h. Pure g-C3N4
(denoted as CN) was fabricated by directly annealing thiourea at
500 C for 4 h at an increasing rate of 10 C min1.
2.2. Physicochemical characterization
The crystalline structure of the as-prepared photocatalysts was
examined through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a D8
Advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS company, Germany)
with a Cu-Ka (1.5406 A) as the referring source operated at 30 kV
and 10 mA. The XRD scans were recorded in the 2q range of 10e80
with a scanning rate of 7 min1 and a step size of 0.01 (0.5s/step).
The morphological characteristics of the as-synthesized materials
were investigated using a scanning electronmicroscope (SEM, Nova
Nano SEM 450), and a high-resolution transmission electron mi-
croscope (HR-TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 F (JEOL,
Japan) operating at 200 kV. The materials were coated with gold to
prevent charge build-up during SEM examinations. The Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples in the
400e4000 cm1 range with a resolution of 4 cm1 were obtained
on an IR Prestige-21 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using KBr
pellets containing a 1% weight sample. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was conducted using a SETRAM LABSYS TG system with
airflow and heating rate of 10 C min1. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) data were obtained with a K-Alpha þ Thermo
Scientific system. A Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer with a
spherical diffuse reflectance accessory was used to determine the
bandgap energy of catalysts using UVevis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the
synthesized samples were obtained using an iHR-550 fluorescence
spectrophotometer stimulated at 355 nm.
2.3. Photocatalytic activity evaluation
The photocatalytic performance of the obtained samples was
assessed on the basis of RhB photodegradation in an aqueous so-
lution under visible light exposure. A typical experiment was
conducted with a catalyst dose of 20 mg dispersed in 80 mL of RhB
solution with a concentration of 20 mg/L. The obtained dispersion
was continually stirred for 1.5 h in the dark to achieve the2
adsorptionedesorption equilibrium. The mixed solution was then
illuminated with a 60 We220 V lamp with a UV cutoff filter
(200e400 nm). At predefined intervals, an aliquot of the reaction
solution was obtained and promptly centrifuged at 5000 rpm for
10 min to remove the catalyst. The residual concentration of RhB
dye was determined with a UVevis spectrophotometer at
lmax ¼ 553 nm.
The photocatalytic mechanism was investigated via trapping
experiments of the main active species. Various scavengers,
namely, benzoquinone (BQ, 10 mM), tert-butyl alcohol (TBA,
10 mM), and ammonium oxalate (AO, 10 mM), were added to the
aqueous RhB solution containing the catalyst to trap radical anions
(O2
), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and holes (hþ), respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of materials
The crystalline structures of CN, SNS, and SCNx composites
subjected to XRD analysis are shown in Fig. 1a. The XRD pattern of
CN shows two distinct prominent peaks around 13.1 and 27.4,
corresponding to the (100) and (002) diffraction crystal planes of
graphite-like materials, respectively [2]. Particularly, the broad and
weak peak at 2q ¼ 13.1 corresponds to an in-plane structural
packing motif, and the sharp and intense peak at 27.4 originates
from the interplanar stacking of p-conjugated aromatic segments
[12]. The 2 T-type hexagonal-phase SnS2 (PDF#23-0677) may be
indexed to all the major diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of SNS.
However, the characteristic peaks of the g-C3N4 phase are absent in
the XRD pattern of SNS, indicating that g-C3N4 in SCN30 is
completely decomposed at 650 C. The main peaks of g-C3N4 and
SnS2 are observed in all SnS2/g-C3N4 composites, and no other
impurity peaks are detected, demonstrating that their crystal
structures are retained after hybridization. The intensity of the
(002) peak of g-C3N4 steadily increases as the amount of thiourea
added to the precursormixtures increases, indicating the content of
this component in the composites is higher than that of the other
components. In general, the XRD results demonstrate that com-
posites with coexisting SnS2 and g-C3N4 are successfully con-
structed using facile and economic calcination.
The bonding characteristics of the synthesized materials were
investigated through FTIR spectroscopy. In Fig. 1b, the FTIR spec-
trum of CN presents a series of peaks with a strong intensity in the
range of 1238e1640 cm1, which is assigned to the feature
stretching vibrations of the CeN and C]N bonds in g-C3N4 het-
erocycles [13]. Moreover, the typical sharp peaks at 802 and
891 cm1 are involved with bending modes and NeH stretching
modes in heptazine units, respectively [19]. The FTIR spectrum of
CN also exhibits a wide absorption band at 3000e3300 cm1,
belonging to the NeH stretching vibration modes of the terminal
amino groups or OeH bonds of surface-adsorbed water molecules
[1]. Notably, the appearance of all the feature peaks of g-C3N4 in
SnS2/g-C3N4 composites confirms the absence of the influence of
SnS2 introduction on the g-C3N4 structure. The intensity of g-C3N4
peaks in the composite gradually increases from SCN25 to SCN30
and SCN35, implying an increase in the g-C3N4 content in the
composite materials. This finding is consistent with the previous
XRD discussion. For SNS, a signal with a modest absorption peak is
detected at 552 cm1, corresponding to the characteristic mode of
the SneS bond. However, this featured signal of SnS2 is invisible in
the IR spectra of the composites because of the low relative content
of SnS2 [10]. Furthermore, the absorption peaks centered at
2300 cm1 belonging to the stretching vibration of the physically
adsorptive CO2 in the atmosphere are recorded in the spectra of the
SCNx composites [3,14].

T.H. Nguyen Thi, H.T. Huu, H.N. Phi et al. Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices 7 (2022) 100402The thermostability of CN, SNS, and SCNx samples investigated
through TGA analysis is illustrated in Fig. 1c. Two main steps of a
total weight loss process are observable in the TGA curves of all the
samples. In the first step (from room temperature to 150 C),
physically adsorbed water on a material surface and volatile im-
purities evaporate. In the second step, SnS2 oxidizes to SnO2 (from
350 C to 540 C) [15], and g-C3N4 thermally decomposes (about
550 C) [16], thereby causing a considerable weight loss (between
350 C and 600 C). The TGA profile of CN shows its intrinsic
thermal instability at above 400 C, and decomposition is
completed at 620 C. In comparisonwith CN, the second step of the
composites occurs at a lower temperature. This result indicates that
the thermal stability of g-C3N4 in the composite structure likely
decreases mainly because of the influence of SnS2 crystallization on
the in-plane structural stacking motif of the g-C3N4 phase and the
catalytic role of SnS2 on the partial oxidation of the g-C3N4 sup-
porting under air atmosphere. This phenomenon has also been
observed in other materials, such as g-C3N4/ZnO [17], MoS2/g-C3N4
[18], and In2O3/g-C3N4 [19]. No remarkable weight loss is observed
in the TGA curve of SNS and the composites above 550 C, con-
firming that SnS2 is completely converted to SnO2. Based on the
TGA results, the estimated relative weights of SnS2 in SNS, SCN25,
SCN30, and SCN35 are 98.93 wt%, 43.04 wt%, 18.43 wt%, and
13.34 wt%, respectively (The detailed calculation was shown in
Supplementary Information). This finding is consistent with the
obtained IR and XRD results, implying that the loading of SnS2
decreases when the added amount of the g-C3N4 (thiourea) source
in the as-prepared composites increases.
Fig. 2 illustrates the morphological characteristics and
elemental composition of CN and SCN30. In Fig. 2a, a typical SEM
image of CN presents bulk morphology of nonuniform layers with a
fairly smooth surface stacking them together. This 2D sheet-like
structure tends to agglomerate under the given preparation con-
dition. The magnified SEM image of SCN30 (Fig. 2b) shows folded
SnS2 nanoflakes, which grow in stacks with a layer-by-layer
structure after they are grafted onto g-C3N4. The appearance of
SnS2 nanosheets prevents the aggregation of the g-C3N4 substrate,3
resulting in an enlarged specific surface on the composite.
Accordingly, the pathways of the transport and separation of
photoinduced charges between semiconductors may be enhanced.
Furthermore, the TEM image of the composite in Fig. 2c reveals that
the as-synthesized few-layered SnS2 nanosheets are less agglom-
erated and well distributed in the porous g-C3N4 matrix. The
concentric bright rings of small diffraction spots are visible in the
selected area electron diffraction results, corresponding to the
(002), (100), (101) (102), and (110) lattice planes and indicating the
polynanocrystalline feature of SCN30. The HR-TEM image at a
higher magnification of SCN30 (Fig. 2d) presents the lattice fringes
of SnS2 nanosheets with an interlayer spacing of (d(002)) plane
ranging from 0.59 nm to 0.65 nm. This finding can be attributed to
the formation of a large amount of gases emitted during thiourea
decomposition, leading to the increased exfoliation and expansion
of SnS2 nanosheets [20]. Elemental mapping was performed to
demonstrate SnS2 dispersion on g-C3N4 in the composites. In
Fig. 2e2-4, the elemental mapping images confirm that S, Sn, and N
are homogeneously distributed in the as-prepared composite.
Overall, these results indicate that the unique nanostructure of the
SnS2/g-C3N4 coupled material, which is composed of evenly
dispersed SnS2 nanosheets on the g-C3N4 supporting, can signifi-
cantly enhance the generation and separation of photoexcited
charges during photocatalysis.
XPS technique was implemented to determine surface binding
properties of CN, SNS, and SCN30 (representative composite). The
high-resolution C1s spectrum (Fig. 3a) can be deconvoluted into
three characteristic peak components of the carbon atom of g-C3N4.
The first component with a binding energy of 284.5 eV is attributed
to the C]C bonding of the graphitic structure, the second
component at 286.2 eV is related to C]N species, and the last
component at 288.0 eV corresponds to C sp2 of N]CeN within the
tri-s-triazine ring moieties [20]. Remarkably, these signals also
appear in the C1s spectrum of SCN30. The N1s spectrum of CN
possesses three contributions (Fig. 3b). In particular, the peak at a
binding energy of 398.6 eV corresponds to sp2-hybridized N (C]
NeC) [21], and the peaks at 399.8 and 401.3 eV belong to pyrrolic N

functional groups (CeNeH), respectively [22]. The S2p XPS signals
(Fig. 3c) are fitted into the peaks centered at 161.8 eV (S2p3/2) and
163.1 eV (S2p1/2), which are associated with S2 chemical states in
the SnS2 lattice [15]. Fig. 3d illustrates the high-resolution spectrum
of Sn3d with peaks at 486.7 and 495.1 eV, indicating the Sn3d5/2
and Sn3d3/2 core levels, respectively; thus, these findings confirm
the existence of the Sn4þ valence state in SNS [23]. Interestingly, the
binding energy of Sn3d and S2p of SCN30 negatively shifts
compared with that of SNS, suggesting that electrons migrate be-
tween g-C3N4 and SnS2 at their heterojunction interface [24]. This
may contribute to charge separation in photocatalytic reactions.
Thus, the XPS data strongly support the results obtained through
XRD and FTIR, which provide clear evidence of the coexistence of
two components (SnS2 and g-C3N4) in the composite. Additionally,
stability of the composites was studied. Accordingly, the SCN30
sample stored in a vial with closed cover for 5 months was char-
acterized using XRD. The simultaneous presence of the two distinct
diffraction peak systems corresponding to the two components of
SnS2 and g-C3N4 can be observed in Fig. S1. This result shows no4
significant change in the crystal structure compared to the initial
SCN30 composite, confirming the stability of SnS2/g-C3N4.
3.2. Photocatalytic activities
In this study, the photocatalytic performance of all the samples
was evaluated through RhB photodegradation under visible light
irradiation. In Fig. 4a, 37.01% and 45.70% of RhB are decomposed
after 6 h of irradiation of SNS and CN, respectively. The RhB
degradation percentages of all SnS2/g-C3N4 composites are superior
to those of the separated components. Among these photocatalysts,
SCN30 exhibits the highest RhB degradation efficiency of 92.22%.
For comparison, two controlled experiments were carried out: one
without visible light irradiation and the other without photo-
catalyst addition. The results reveal that RhB can be negligibly
degraded in the two cases, suggesting that the degradation effi-
ciency of RhB is attributed to the photocatalytic reaction in the
presence of coexisting photocatalyst and light photon. Tradition-
ally, a LangmuireHinshelwood model is used to assess the kinetics
of photocatalytic progress. A linear relationship between ln (Co/C)

T.H. Nguyen Thi, H.T. Huu, H.N. Phi et al. Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices 7 (2022) 100402and the irradiation time t of the samples is shown in Fig. 4b.
Accordingly, the obtained data arewell fittedwith the pseudo-first-
order kinetic reaction shown in the following equation: ln (Co/
C) ¼ k$t, where Co and C refer to the initial and measured con-
centrations of RhB after irradiation time t, respectively, and k is the
rate constant. k of all the composites is much greater than that of
any single component, confirming the outstanding photocatalytic
capability of SnS2/g-C3N4 heterogeneous semiconductors. Among
the composites, SCN30 has the highest reaction rate constant
(0.44402 h1), which is about 1.57 and 2.20 times higher than those
of SCN25 (0.28279 h1) and SCN35 (0.20179 h1), respectively
(Table S1). This phenomenon suggests that a reasonable amount of
the g-C3N4 supporting enhances the transfer and separation
channels of photoinduced carriers, thereby improving photo-
catalytic behavior. However, the overuse of the g-C3N4 substrate in
the composite can diminish the photocatalytic activity of RhB
removal because its properties are similar to those of bare g-C3N4
[25]. Another reason is that excessive g-C3N4 loading can trigger the
shielding effect of g-C3N4 on SnS2, leading to decreased light ab-
sorption and limited contact between SnS2 and oxidative species
[7]. The effect of pH on the photocatalytic activity of a represen-
tative sample, SCN30 was investigated, indicating that the
maximum degradation of RhB was obtained at pH of about 3.8
closing to the pH of RhB solution. A decrease in degradation effi-
ciency was observed when increasing pH (Fig. S2). To enable the
degradation of RhB on the catalysts under visible-light irradiation
only due to photocatalytic reaction, the adsorption on the photo-
catalysts was demonstrated (Fig. S3).
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CN and
SCN30 were obtained under an excitation wavelength of 355 nm to
further demonstrate the extension in the lifetime of charge carriers.
In Fig. S4, the PL spectrum of CN can be deconvoluted into four
symmetric Gaussian peaks centered at A (433.8 nm, 2.86 eV), B
(455.9 nm, 2.72 eV), C (488.5 nm, 2.54 eV), and D (523.6 nm,
2.37 eV). Previous studies showed that the electronic band states of
g-C3N4 consist of the s band (sp3 CeN bond), p band (sp2 CeN
bond), and lone-pair (LP) electrons of bridge N atoms [26]. The
four emission peaks (in the order fromA to D) of CN reflect different
transitions, namely, s* conduction band (CB)/s valence band5
(VB), s*/LP, p*/PL, and p*/p, respectively [27,28]. The
measured emission energy of the B peak is 2.72 eV, which is similar
to the bandgap energy of CN from its UVevis DRS spectrum. The
energy to form the PL emission of g-C3N4 can be released by the
recombination of photogenerated charges as a result of C vacancies
and unpaired lone electrons [7]. In Fig. 4c, CN has a strong emission
peak at around 450 nm, suggesting its serious electronehole
recombination rate [23]. However, the intensity of this featured
emission peak decreases significantly after the SCN30 composite is
constructed. This finding confirms that the presence of SnS2 in the
composite efficiently reduces the recombination of excited
electronehole pairs, thus improving the performance of the pho-
tocatalytic system.
The role of dissolved oxygen in the removal efficiency of RhBwas
evaluated using SCN30 as a representative sample. The solutionwas
purged continuously with nitrogen or oxygen before and after
irradiation. Fig. 4d shows that the RhB degradation rate on SCN30 in
air reaches around 92.22% and increases significantly to 98.02%with
O2 purging. Only 74.86% of RhB is degraded in the presence of N2
stream after 6 h of irradiation. In addition, the experimental results
fitted with the pseudo-first-order kinetics reveal the highest value
of constant rate in the experimentwith O2 (k¼ 0.65055 h1), which
is around 1.47 and 2.88 times higher than those in air (0.44402 h1)
and N2 (0.22589 h1), respectively (Fig. S5a). This result confirms
that O2 contributes to photocatalytic RhB degradation, which can
simply capture excited electrons on the CB of semiconductors, thus
inhibiting the electronehole recombination probability. Further-
more, the effects of primary reactive species on the photocatalysis of
SCN30 under visible light irradiation were studied. Herein, three
chemicals, i.e., BQ, TBA, and AO, were added as quenchers of O2
,
OH, and hþ, respectively. The results shown in Fig. 4e demonstrate
that the photodegradation efficiency of RhB decreases in the pres-
ence of scavengers. Remarkably, after 6 h of irradiation, the degra-
dation efficiency decreases considerably to 48.55% with the added
BQ, and the photocatalytic efficiency decreases to 70.81% in the
presence of TBA. By contrast, the RhB degradation percentage does
not significantly change when AO is used. In Fig. S5b, the reaction
rate constants show the following trend: AO (0.41022 h1) > TBA
(0.21330 h1) > BQ (0.11185 h1). These results determine that O2

T.H. Nguyen Thi, H.T. Huu, H.N. Phi et al. Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices 7 (2022) 100402and OH are the dominant reactive species, whereas hþ negligibly
influences RhB photodegradation.
The optical properties of the materials were examined through
UVevis DRS spectroscopy (Fig. 4f) to further understand the
enhancement in the photocatalytic properties of the obtained
heterojunction system. CN displays a strong absorption edge at a
wavelength of approximately 450 nm, which corresponds to an
intrinsic bandgap energy of about 2.72 eV. The value of the bandgap
of CN is consistent with the previously reported results [7,9]. By
contrast, SNS has a broad absorption edge of up to 650 nm because
of its narrow bandgap (about 1.89 eV). The absorption curves of the
composites are similar to those of CN (Fig. S6) because of the
coating of the g-C3N4 supporting on SnS2. The bandgap energy of
semiconductors can be calculated on the basis of the
KubelkaeMunk function equation S1 and is listed in Table S2,
indicating that the obtained materials can be activated under
visible light condition. The obtained data on the flat band potentials
of g-C3N4 and SnS2 are calculated using equations S2 and S3 and
presented in Table S3. The CB and VB positions of the two semi-
conductors are illustrated in Fig. 5.
A photocatalytic mechanism can be proposed on the basis of the
aforementioned studies on radical species trapping and bandgapFig. 5. The schematic diagrams of (a) type-II and (c) S-scheme photocatalytic mechanisms o

energy. In Fig. 5, two coupled semiconductors present staggered
band structures. Their charge transfer behavior is discussed in
detail in two ways. The first system is a conventional type-II charge
transfer mode (Fig. 5a). In this case, both semiconductors are
simultaneously excited to create photoinduced electrons and holes
under light irradiation. Then, the CB excited-state electrons of g-
C3N4 can transport to the CB of SnS2, whereas the VB photoinduced
holes from SnS2 can migrate to the VB of g-C3N4. Accordingly,
photogenerated electrons likely accumulate on the CB of SnS2 with
a low reduction potential, whereas photogenerated holes tend to
accumulate on the VB of g-C3N4 with a low oxidation potential. This
transfermode reduces the redox ability of the composite, leading to
a low driving force toward specific photocatalytic reactions.
Therefore, the electrons on the CB of the SnS2 semiconductor with a
more positive reduction potential than the standard reduction
potential of E(O2
/O2) ¼ 0.33 eV (vs. NHE) [10] cannot directly
interact with O2 to produce O2
 radicals. In comparison with the
experimental results on radical suppression, the traditional type-II
model is inconsistent because the signal of the main active species
(O2
) is not found. The charge transfer mechanism in a hetero-
structure system operating in this mode is also problematic from a
dynamic perspective because of the significant electrostaticn the SnS2/g-C3N4 composite. (b) Electron transformation due to different Fermi levels
T.H. Nguyen Thi, H.T. Huu, H.N. Phi et al. Journal of Science: Advanced Materials and Devices 7 (2022) 100402repulsion between electrons and holes [29]. In the second system,
the S-scheme mechanism is analogous to the type-II system but
involves an entirely different charge migration pathway (Fig. 5b,c).
According to density functional theory calculations, the Fermi en-
ergy (Ef) of SnS2 with awork function of 6.0 eV is higher than that of
g-C3N4 with a work function of 4.3 eV [30]. Therefore, after g-C3N4
combines with SnS2, electrons tend to accumulate on the SnS2 site,
leading to a depleted region on g-C3N4 at their heterojunction
interface to accomplish Ef balance (Fig. 5b). Consequently, the g-
C3N4 surface is positively charged, whereas the SnS2 surface is
negatively charged at their interface. This charge redistribution
results in the formation of an internal electric field (IEF) at the
heterostructure interface in the geC3N4eto-SnS2 direction. The IEF
can promote interfacial charge transfer, so their separation is
greatly enhanced. As a result of charge redistribution, g-C3N4 and
SnS2 exhibit upward and downward band bending, respectively.
Photoexcited electrons and holes are produced in both semi-
conductors under visible irradiation. The photoinduced electrons
from the CB of SnS2 can easily transport to the VB of g-C3N4 and
quickly and strongly recombine with the photoinduced holes
because of all the driving forces, including electric field, Coulomb
attraction, and force synergistic influence of band bending at the
interface. Ultimately, the CB electrons in g-C3N4 with a stronger
reduction ability and the VB holes in SnS2 with a greater oxidation
ability are preserved. Therefore, the accumulated electrons on the
CB of g-C3N4 with more negative potential than the standard redox
value of E(O2
/O2) ¼ 0.33 eV (vs. NHE) can reduce adsorbed O2
molecules to O2
. Afterward, O2
 radicals are protonated to create
hydroperoxy radicals (OH2) and then generate OH hydroxyl rad-
icals, which are strong oxidative agents in organic dye degradation
[9]. Unfortunately, the positive holes in the VB of SnS2 and g-C3N4,
which have a greater negative VB potential than the standard redox
potential of E(OH/H2O) ¼ 2.27 eV (vs. NHE) [31], cannot oxidize
H2O to OH. However, the photoinduced holes on the VB of SnS2
have a minor role in the direct oxidation of RhB. Clearly, the S-
scheme separation mechanism of photoexcited charges is consis-
tent with the trapping tests, indicating that O2
 and OH radicals
remarkably contribute to the photocatalytic degradation of RhB.
This process is illustrated in the following reactions:
g-C3N4 þ hn / g-C3N4 (e/hþ), (1)
SnS2 þ hn / SnS2 (e/hþ), (2)
e (g-C3N4) þ O2 / O2
, (3)
O2
 þ Hþ / OOH, (4)
OOH þ Hþ þ 2e / OH þ OH, (5)
O2
, OH, hþ þ RhB /degradation products. (6)
The constructed SnS2/g-C3N4 heterogeneous system with a
beneficial synergistic and integrative influence of the two compo-
nents follows the S-scheme charge transport mechanism instead of
the conventional type-II heterojunction structure. Thus, the sepa-
ration and movement of photogenerated electronehole pairs
improve, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the
composite compared with that of the bare photocatalysts (SnS2 and
g-C3N4).
4. Conclusion
We proposed a facile one-pot strategy for fabricating SnS2/g-
C3N4 semiconductorswith various content loadings containing SnS27
nanosheets distributed on a g-C3N4 matrix. The RhB removal effi-
ciency of all the composites was higher than that of bare g-C3N4 and
SnS2. Among resultant photocatalysts, the composite, which was
prepared with a tin (IV) chloride/thiourea mass ratio of 1:30,
exhibited the best performance of 92.22% of RhB photodegradation
with a reaction rate constant of 0.44402 h1 in 6 h of irradiation. The
effective transfer and separation of photoinduced charges between
SnS2 and g-C3N4 in S-scheme heterojunctions is primarily respon-
sible for the increased photocatalytic activity. Therefore, the SnS2/g-
C3N4 system is a potential candidate for application in organic
pollutant photodegradation.
