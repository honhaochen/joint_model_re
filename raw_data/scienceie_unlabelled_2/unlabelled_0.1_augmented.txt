while the total number of roles remains roughly unaltered , distributions distribution of number of cons - nections are tailored by learning [ 67 , 68 ] : the structure of the brain moves from a stage where its primary function drops under perception – action due to active cortical hubs [ 69 , 70 ] towards distributed networks spanning the brain performing a variety of complex cognitive tasks [ 71 ] . Training training of a cortical network bears several resemblances to the synaptic pruning procedure : starting out any fully connected structure , the network goes through an unsupervised phase where connections are pruned through inhibition leaving only ‘
