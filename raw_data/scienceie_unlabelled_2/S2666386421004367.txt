The Li metal anode possesses the high specific capacity and the min-
imum reduction potential known as the renaissance of high-energy-
density battery. However, the security problems brought by uncon-
trolled Li dendrites have hindered its development. Integrating the
Li metal anode with non-flammable solid-state electrolytes (SSEs)
provides a promising approach to solve the problem of Li dendrites
and achieve safe Li metal batteries. However, recent studies indi-
cate that Li dendrites still occur in the interior of inorganic SSEs,
although the high mechanical strength of inorganic SSEs can resist
dendrite growth in theory. In this review, the main causes of Li den-
drites within inorganic SSEs are summarized. Combined with
advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations,
theoretical models of Li dendrite growth within SSEs are clarified.
Furthermore, various strategies for suppressing Li dendrites are
comprehensively summarized. Finally, the research prospects of
dendrite-free all-solid-state Li metal batteries are evaluated.
A rechargeable liquid Li battery (Li||TiS2) was constructed byWhittingham for the first
time in 1976, which showed a high energy density of nearly 500 Wh kg-1.1 After
several years of iteration, Li metal batteries were introduced into the electric vehicle
industry by Moli Energy.2,3 However, these Li metal batteries were recalled due to
safety issues.4,5 Soon after, Li-ion battery was invented in 1985, which consisted of
a LiCoO2 cathode developed by Goodenough and a carbonaceous anode devel-
oped by Yoshino.6,7 The ‘‘rocking chair’’–type charge and discharge of the Li-ion bat-
tery exhibited better stability than that of Li metal battery. Taking advantage of the
long-term cyclic stability of the Li-ion battery, Sony, with its 18650 battery, quickly
occupied the commercial market.8 Since then, Li-ion batteries based on carbona-
ceous anodes have been constantly iterated to now. Nevertheless, with rapid
development of the cathodes (such as LiFePO4
9, LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2
10,etc.), Li-ion
batteries with carbonaceous-based anodes gradually approached the upper limit
of energy density (250 Wh kg-1).11
Recently, the introduction of Si-based anodes has been found to increase the energy
density of a battery to more than 300 Wh kg-1, marking a major milestone in the
development of Li-ion batteries.12 However, once Li metal as the anode (with the
high theoretical capacity of nearly 3860 mAh g-1 or 2061 mAh cm-3 and the lowest
electrochemical potential of nearly 3.04 V versus the standard hydrogen elec-
trode)13,14 paired with the recently developed S-based or O2 cathodes, energyCell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022 ª 2021 The Author(s).

OPEN ACCESS Reviewdensities of 650 Wh kg-1 and 950 Wh kg-1 can be achieved (Figure 1).11 Unfortu-
nately, the security problems brought by uncontrolled Li dendrite growth have seri-
ously hindered the application of the Li metal anode.15 Various strategies (such as
artificial solid-electrolyte interfaces16–19, structured lithiophilic hosts20–22, liquid
electrolyte engineering23–28, and solid-state electrolytes29,30) have been developed
to solve the problem of Li dendrites.31,32
Among the above-mentioned strategies, although it still falls short in high-rate per-
formance compared with flammable liquid electrolytes, non-flammable solid-state
electrolytes (SSEs) are widely expected to solve the security problems brought by
insufficient thermal stability and the growth of Li dendrites.35–40 Furthermore, SSEs
also show better electrochemical stability.38,39 Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs),
with superior flexibility and favorable membrane-forming capability, have been
extensively studied.41,42 However, the low ionic conductivity of SPEs and the issue
of dendrite-penetration through soft SPEs with low shear modulus limit the practical
application of SPEs.43–46 Inorganic SSEs with high ionic conductivity (Li10GeP2S12
12 mS cm-1,47 Li7P3S11 17 mS cm-1 48) and high shear modulus (Li3PS412GPa,492 Li7La3Zr2O12100 GPa50) hold great hope to resist dendrite growth and achieve the
practical application of all-solid-state Li metal batteries.51–55 Nevertheless, with the
advancement of characterization techniques, Li dendrites are still found in the bulk
phase of inorganic SSEs, which gradually grow and penetrate through SSEs, finally
leading to short-circuit and cell failures. Therefore, researchers have conducted in-
depth research on the Li dendrites in the interior of inorganic SSEs.56,57 It is found
that the growth of Li dendrites within inorganic SSEs is related to the voids and pores,
grain boundaries, cracks, electronic conductivity, and critical current density.58
Moreover, several reviews have rarely involved Li dendrites in the interior of inorganic
SSEs.46,59,60 Among them, there are two targeted reviewson Li dendriteswithin SSEs,
which only summarize from the perspective of inorganic and organic SSEs.61–63 How-
ever, systematic analysis for the causes of Li dendrites growthwithin inorganic SSEs is
still relatively scarce. Andendless theoreticalmodels and advanced characterizations
in recent years have emerged to accurately interpret the Li dendrites in the bulk phase
of inorganic SSEs. Therefore, this review focuses on summarizing the main causes of
Li dendrite growthwithin inorganic SSEs. Combinedwith theoretical calculations and
advanced characterizations, mechanistic models of Li dendrite growth within SSEs
are further clarified. Finally, the corresponding strategies of suppressing Li dendrites
are comprehensively summarized, and the research prospects of dendrite-free all-
solid-state Li metal batteries are evaluated (Figure 2).CAUSES OF LI DENDRITES WITHIN INORGANIC SSEs
Compared to soft polymer electrolytes, inorganic SEEs can better resist Li den-
drites due to its high shear modulus in theory.70 However, researchers discovered
a voltage drop during polarization in garnet-based (Li7La3Zr2O12–LLZO) all-solid-
state batteries as the current density increased, which was attributed to short-cir-
cuiting of the battery caused by Li dendrites within SSEs.71 Combined with the
theoretical simulations and advanced characterizations, the growth of Li dendrites
have also been gradually observed in the bulk phase of other inorganic
SSEs.67,72,73 Therefore, it is necessary to systematically analyze the causes of the
Li dendrite growth within inorganic SSEs.74 According to previously reported
studies, the causes of the growth of Li dendrites within inorganic SSEs can be sum-
marized into the following categories.Macroscopic defects
It is well known that the high shear modulus of completely compact inorganic SSEs can
resist the growth of Li dendrites in theory. However, there are always various defects for
practical SSEs. Researchers discovered that macroscopic defects including the voids
and pores promoted the growth of Li dendrites within SSEs.75 Ren et al. 56 found that
once there are voids and pores, the Li dendrites will penetrate through the intercon-
nected pores and voids within ceramic electrolyte (Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12–LLZTO)
and grow along the porous grain boundary (Figures 3A and 3B).
Furthermore, recent research has shown that the growth of Li dendrites would fill all
the voids and pores, and then penetrated from the interior of the SSEs to the cath-
ode, resulting in short-circuit of the battery. Intriguingly, the period before short-cir-
cuit of the battery occurs is positively correlated with the relative density of SSEs,
which is estimated based on the ratio of the density calculated from the lattice con-
stant to the density calculated from the weight and volume. Moreover, the Al2O3-
doped Li7La3Zr2O12 has shown that a long period before short-circuit of the battery
occurs is due to the improved relative density.71Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022 3

Therefore, there is reason to believe that high shear modulus is not enough to
completely inhibit Li dendrite growth in the interior of inorganic SSEs. And macro-
scopic defects including voids and pores should be appropriately suppressed.
Micro defects
Nevertheless, the SSEs with high relative density cannot completely inhibit Li
dendrite penetration through SSEs caused by micro defects such as grain bound-
aries (GBs) and cracks.82,83 Researchers discovered that Li dendrites nucleated
and formed at GBs and cracks, and gradually penetrated through inorganic SSEs, re-
sulting in short-circuit of the battery.844 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022

Li dendrites easily nucleate at the defects of GBs and subsequently penetrate the entire
SSE along the pre-existing defects of GBs, whether it is single crystal or polycrystalline,
causing a short-circuit of the battery.85–87 Furthermore, the penetrativemode of Li den-
drites within polycrystalline SSEs is influenced by themechanical properties andmicro-
structure of the GBs (Figure 3C).72 Due to the softening of the GBs, the compressive
stress at the interface and the shear modulus at GBs is reduced. Consequently, Li metal
nucleates atGBand Li/SSEs interface andgradually penetrates throughSSEs.82 In addi-
tion, excessive trapping of electrons at GBs would trigger the nucleation of Li dendrites
and increase the penetrating depth of Li dendrites.75,77
Cracks are another reason to promote Li dendrites penetration in the interior of inor-
ganic SSEs. Based on the mechanical crack mechanism, once the cracks occur withinCell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022 5
inorganic SSEs, the Li filaments would grow along cracks and gradually penetrate
SSEs and ultimately leads to short-circuit of the battery (Figure 3D).88
To conclude, micro defects like GB and cracks contribute to Li dendrite growth and
penetration in the bulk phase of inorganic SSEs; therefore, they require inhibition as
well.
Physical defects
Ideal SSEs with highmechanical strength and low electrical conductivity could inhibit
the growth of Li dendrites. However, physical defects such as high local electronic
conductivity of SSEs could directly reduce Li+ to Li metal in the bulk phase of inor-
ganic SSEs and gradually form Li dendrites within inorganic SSEs.63
John A. Kilner et al.73 put forward that partial electronic conductivity of crystalline
SSEs could provide electronic conductive pathways for Li nucleation within inorganic
SSEs (Figure 3E). In other words, where there are electrons, there will be continuous
Li nucleation and deposition. In addition, Wang’s group also proved that the high
electronic conductivity of Li3PS4 and Li7La3Zr2O12 was mostly responsible for
dendrite formation in these SSEs.89 Generally, it was assumed that the high elec-
tronic conductivity of SSEs provided an electronic pathway for the direct reduction
of Li+ to Li metal at grain boundary/pore of SSEs, and Li dendrites gradually formed
and permeated through entire SSEs, eventually leading to short-circuit of the battery
(Figure 3F).67,90
Therefore, it is necessary to lower the electrical conductivity of SSEs to suppress Li
dendrites in the bulk phase of inorganic SSEs.
Physical property
The formationof Li dendrites is also related tophysical property, such as critical current
density (CCD). The maximum endurable current density of Li metal batteries cycling
without cell failures in all-solid-state Li batteries is generally defined as CCD (usually
reported as less than 1mA cm-2).59,91–93 Once the applied current density is larger
thanCCD, SSEswill not transport enough Li+ in time for reaction, resulting in large con-
centration polarization and electron accumulation, and then leading to Li dendrite
nucleation and penetration and short-circuit of the battery (Figures 3G and 3H).67
All-solid-state Li batteries with inorganic SSEs show high cyclic stability and high
coulomb efficiency at low current densities. However, Li dendrite growth still
occurred in the bulk phase of inorganic SSEs at high current densities, even though
the high mechanical strength of inorganic SSEs could resist dendrite growth in the-
ory. Due to the smaller CCD than organic electrolytes, Li dendrites are more likely to
form within inorganic SSEs, especially at high current densities. For example, the
CCD values of Li7La3Zr2O12 (0.05 to 0.9 mA cm-2) and Li2S-P2S5 (0.4 to 1 mA cm-2)
are much lower than that of organic electrolytes (3 to10 mA cm-2).94
Therefore, other strategies are required to improve the CCD of SSEs and inhibit Li
dendrite growth within inorganic SSEs.
ADVANCED CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES AND THEORETICAL
MODELS
Different from batteries with liquid electrolytes, initial growth of Li dendrites can
either happen in the interface of Li/SSEs interface or in the interior of SSEs. With
the help of advanced characterization techniques and theoretical simulations, the6 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022
theoretical models and the main causes of Li dendrites within SSEs have been grad-
ually analyzed and clarified.
Advanced characterization techniques
Advanced characterization techniques play an important role in the analysis of Li
dendrites growth within SSEs. The main directions of characterization are: (1)
observing and confirming Li dendrite growth within SSEs and (2) elucidating the
causes of Li dendrites within SSEs.
With the continuous efforts of researchers and the gradual application of advanced
characterizations, Li dendrites within SSEs have been observed in short-circuited batte-
ries.95 For the first time, Li dendrites in the interior of polymer electrolytes were
observed in short-circuited batteries by using in situ scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) in 2002 (Figure 4A). It was shown that Li dendrite growth at the interface could
further penetrate through soft polymer electrolytes with insufficient shear modulus.
Similarly, Nagao et al. 72 directly observed columnar Li deposition in short-circuited
battery based on Li2S–P2S5 by using SEM in 2013 (Figure 4B). Furthermore, optical mi-
croscopy and in situmini cell were also used to observe the Li dendrites growth within
optically SSEs.96,97After that, dual-beam (Focused ionbeam)FIB-SEMrevealed that the
hard and hollow Li dendrites could penetrate through soft polymer electrolytes in the
short-circuited battery (Figure 4D).98 Besides, atomic force microscopy (AFM) com-
binedwith environmental transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) was used to observe
the in situ growth of individual Li whiskers in the bulk phase of SSEs, which provides a
quantitative benchmark for inhibiting Li dendrite growth within SSEs.74
Although Li dendrites within SSEs have been observed in short-circuited batteries, it
is necessary to provide the direct evidence by advanced characterizations to prove
that the growth of dendrites within SSEs is Limetal. High resolution transmission elec-
tron microscope (TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was first be
used to confirm that Li dendrites growth at GBs of Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12(LLZTO)
in 2016 (Figure 4C).75 Then, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) with precise chemical
sensitivity77 and non-destructive neutron depth profiling (NDP) analysis technology
were used to prove that Li propagates preferably along the grain boundary of Li7-
La3Zr2O12(LLZO) during cycling, resulting in the short-circuit of Li/LLZO/Li symmetric
battery (Figures 4E and 4F).99 Besides, Marbella et al.100 confirmed that short-circuit
of the battery was obviously related to Li dendrites within LLZTO by using 7Li Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift imaging in 2019 (Figure 4G).103
Visualizing the process of reaction within SSEs is also helpful to understand the
growth of Li dendrites within SSEs. In situ X-ray computed tomography in micro
nanoscale78 and in situ space X-ray diffraction101 were first used to visualize the pro-
cess of crack evolution in the interior of SSEs, which included Li deposition and Li
dendrites penetration (Figures 4H and 4I). Besides, in situ microscopic and cryo-
TEM were reported to provide visual evidence for the dynamic process of Li den-
drites formation and penetration within SSEs in 2021 (Figure 4J).102
After the discoveries and confirmations of Li dendrites within SSEs, advanced char-
acterization techniques have also been used to reveal the causes of this phenome-
non. Among them, X-ray tomography was first widely used. Synchrotron X-ray micro
tomography technology was first used in 2014 to prove that the unstable interface of
Li/polymer electrolytes induced Li dendrite growth at the interface and further pene-
trated through soft polymer electrolytes with insufficient shear modulus in Fig-
ure 5A.104 Similarly, synchrotron X-ray tomography was used in 2018 to confirmCell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022 7

that the connective pores could reduce critical current density and accelerate Li
dendrite growth within Li7La3Zr2O12, as shown in Figure 5B.105 Besides, in situ
X-ray computed tomography, space X-ray diffraction,101 and in situ synchrotron
X-ray tomography technology106 were used to demonstrate that Li dendrites grow
at the crack of Li/SSEs interface and gradually penetrate into SSEs along the entire
crack, eventually leading to short-circuit of the battery in Figure 5F.
Furthermore, time-resolved operational NDP was used to visualize the nucleation
and growth of Li dendrites within SSEs, as shown in Figure 5C.89 The results indicate
that the high electrical conductivity of Li7La3Zr2O12 and Li3PS4 was the main cause of
Li dendrite growth within SSEs. Moreover, conductive-atomic force microscopy
(c-AFM)108 in Figure 5E and atom probe tomography experiments without beam
damage in Figure 5G102 were used to elucidate the causes of Li dendrites within
SSEs. It was shown that the GBs and heterogeneous surface of the SSEs were the
dynamic characteristics and physical origin of Li dendrites growth within SSEs. In
addition, cryo-transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown Li nucleated and
propagated directly in Li3PS4, which was attributed to P- and S-based crystalline de-
fects, leading to structural crack and short-circuit of the battery.
Combining equipment with the advantages of multiple characterizations should be
adopted to accurately study the causes of Li dendrites within SSEs. In situ SEM electro-
deposition with elaborate neutron measurements was used to confirm that the micro
dynamics of SSEs could induce Li penetration through SSEs as shown in Figure 5D.107
Moreover, in situ high-resolution TEM and spherical aberration correction–electronmi-
croscopy equipped with valence state electron energy-loss spectroscopy were utilized
to prove that electrons provided by the narrow band gap of GBs were confirmed to
easily reduce Li+ to Li dendrites within SSEs, leading to short-circuit of the battery as
shown in Figure 5H.80
Theoretical models
Although SSEs with high shear modulus (at least twice that of Li metal) could resist Li
dendrite growth according to the Munroe’s linear elastic theory model in Fig-
ure 6A,70 the short-circuit was still observed in solid-state batteries with high shear
modulus.110 Subsequently, Monroe et al. proved that the main cause of short-circuit
of the battery was the internal Li dendrites within SSEs, based on space-charge-layer
coupling in 2019.111
As observation has clearly shown and deeper study of Li dendrite growth within SSEs
according to section 3.1 has revealed, many theoretical models have been gradually
proposed to theoretically explain Li dendrite growth within SSEs. Various factors
affecting the Li dendrite growth within SSEs have been studied, including grain
boundaries, critical current density, pores, cracks, and electronic conductivity.
According to section 2.2, Li dendrites are easily induced through nucleation and
penetration along the GBs within SSEs. As shown in Figure 6B, Raj et al. 112,118 first
proposed an analytical model based on the electrochemical-mechanical potential,
which showed that the local high resistance of GBs induced the nucleation of Li den-
drites. Therefore, in consideration of the effects of Li nucleation at GBs and interfa-
cial resistance, a density-driven stabilization mechanism was developed to better
predict the Li penetration within inorganic SSEs.119
Furthermore, Yu and Siegel87 proposed that significant softening in elastic proper-
ties could reduce shear modulus of SSEs in nanoscale regions near GBs, resulting in10 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022
the penetration of Li dendrites within SSEs (Figure 6E). Similarly, the multiscale
model was established by Srinivasan to explain that the high concentration of Li+
and the low elastic modulus in the GBs led to the high current density, resulting in
Li dendrites formation within SSEs in Figure 6J.92 Moreover, Chen et al.84 con-
structed an electrochemical mechanical–phase field model, which revealed that
the softening of GBs and the excess electrons in GBs induced isolated Li metal nucle-
ation within SSEs and deeper penetration of Li dendrites along the GBs of polycrys-
talline Li7La3Zr2O12 as shown in Figure 6L.
Barai et al.93,113 first constructed a phase diagram to describe the relationship between
the deposition of Li metal and the current density in solid polymer electrolyte in 2017,
which suggested that the growth of Li dendriteswas determined by critical current den-
sity (CCD) as shown in Figure 6C. Furthermore, some mechanism models in regard to
the effects of Li/SSEs interface on CCD were gradually proposed.63 It was manifested
that the poor wettability, and lithiophobic and uneven contact of the Li/SSEs interface
greatly lowered the CCD of SSEs and induced the growth of Li dendrites.120
Cracks played an important role in accelerating the penetration of Li dendrites. A
model for the internal cracks of SSEs121 and the reaction mechanism at the SSEs/Li
interface122 were reported, which verified that huge volume expansion and stress
caused by Li deposition at SSEs/Li interface were the fundamental cause of the crack,
leading to the Li penetration and short-circuit of the battery. Besides, Swamy et al.123
constructed an electrochemical mechanical model to explain how the defect of Li/SSEs
interface induced Li penetration, thus resulting in short-circuit of the battery.
As shown in Figure 6D, the electrochemical mechanical model of Li-filled cracks was
first proposed to explain that Li dendrites nucleated and propagated through the
brittle SSEs via Griffith-like crack extension, resulting in short-circuit of the battery.85
Similarly, Kazyak et al.88 verified themechanical cracking mechanism that the infiltra-
tion of Li metal within the ceramic SSEs in 2020, which showed that the penetration
rate of Li dendrites was proportional to the current density as shown in Figure 6I.
Furthermore, Yuan et al.117 established an electrochemical-mechanical coupled
phase field model for the first time by quantitatively investigating the growth and
the crack propagation of Li dendrites within SSEs, which confirmed that Li dendrites
tend to grow at crack zones as shown in Figure 6K. Therefore, increasing the fracture
threshold strain and fracture energy could be helpful to inhibit cracks and suppress Li
dendrites within SSEs.
High relative electronic conductivity of SSEs is an important reason leading to Li
dendrite growth within SSEs. Wang et al.115 first proposed that Li dendrites wereFigure 6. Theoretical models of Li dendrites growth within SSEs

OPEN ACCESSReviewformed within SSEs when the applied potential was greater than the critical overpo-
tential (h*) based on the Butler-Volmer model as shown in Figure 6G. Once the local
electronic conductivity of SSEs is high enough, the atomic Li electrochemical poten-
tial in SSEs will drop to a potential similar to the Li plating on the anode, thus causing
nucleation and growth of Li dendrites within SSEs. Density functional theory (DFT)
was also used to simulate the Li nucleation tendency in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), which
showed that the trapped excess electrons were distributed around the La atoms
on the LLZO surface and induced the reduction of Li+ to Li metal.124 Moreover,
the coupled phase field model in section 3.2.3 also shows that excessive surface
electrons will affect the initial position of Li dendrites in GBs of the LLZO.
There are some other factors that could affect the growth of Li dendrites within SSEs.
Ren et al.116 developed a phase field model to simulate the growth of Li dendrites
within composite SSEs (Figure 6H), which confirmed that the elastic modulus and
the width of electrolyte nanochannel were two key factors controlling Li dendrite
growth within composite SSEs. Nevertheless, Wang et al.125 proved that the stack-
ing pressure significantly influenced Li dendrite growth, crack propagation, and
interface stability from the mechanical perspective by describing the Li/SSEs dy-
namic interface as a function of superimposed pressure and current density. It could
be concluded that the high yield strength of Li metal at higher current densities
reduced the initial formation time and increased the growth rate of Li dendrites
by constructing a multiscale model to capture Li dendrite growth within the
Li7La3Zr2O12.
92
The growth of Li dendrites within SSEs is not controlled by a single factor but a com-
bination of multiple factors. Qi et al.114 first reported a multiscale model coupled
density functional theory (DFT) calculation with the phase-field method, confirming
that the internal defects, pores and GBs junction, and their electronic conducting
properties could induce Li dendrites growth within SSEs in Figure 6F. Furthermore,
Yuan et al.126 established an electrochemical coupling mechanism to comprehen-
sively explain the Li dendrite growth within SSEs. It was indicated that the nucleation
of Li dendrites started from the initial defects such as pores, voids, cracks, and GBs.
Moreover, high relative electronic conductivity and insufficient critical current den-
sity provided a driving force for the growth of Li dendrites within SSEs. Finally, Li
dendrites further grow and penetrate through entire SSEs, resulting in short-circuit
of the battery.SUPPRESSING LI DENDRITES WITHIN SSEs
Based on the abovementioned mechanism and advanced characterizations, various
strategies have been proposed to suppress Li dendrites within SSEs.Increasing relative density
Increasing the relative density of SSEs could directly reduce the voids and pores of
SSEs, thus suppressing Li dendrites within SSEs.
Adjusting the synthesizing strategies of SSEs was proved to be an effective way to
improve the relative density of SSEs. Guo et al.127 prepared high relative density
(96%) of Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) by flow oxygen sintering process for the
first time. The oxygen filling and lattice diffusion could effectively remove the
pores near the grain boundary via optimization of the sintering atmosphere. Simi-
larly, Yamada et al.128 obtained 96% of the relative density of LLZTO by using the
spark plasma technique as shown in Figure 7A. Moreover, the casting–sintering
technique129, cold isostatic pressing technique130, rapid induction hot pressing
technique131 and uniaxial hot-pressing sintering technique132 were also confirmed
to improve relative density by integrating GBs and reducing the pores and voids of
SSEs.
Introducing doping elements and oxide into SSEs is another effective way to in-
crease relative density of SSEs. Murugan et al.137 adopted hot isostatic post-sinter-
ing technology to prepare Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 with a high relative density of 98%,
by adding 1 wt.% Li4SiO4, which could enhance the integrity of GBs and minimize
pores. Similarly, Ta-substituted75 and Al2O3-doped Li7La3Zr2O12
57 also achieved a
high relative density (more than 99%) by hot press sintering.
Grain boundary modification
Previous studies suggested that the short-circuit of the battery is due to Li dendrite
growth within SSEs brought by Li nucleation and permeation along GBs, so GB
modification and other strategies were proposed to completely suppress Li
dendrites.138
Surface treatments could effectively inhibit Li dendrite growth along GBs and avoid
the direct contact between Li metal and GBs. Tsai et al.75 polished the surface of
Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 and introduced an Au buffer layer, which improved ionic
conductivity of GBs and adjusted Li/SSEs interface to inhibit Li dendrite growth at
GBs. Similarly, coating a thin Li+ conducting polymer139 and introducing a Li-Ag
alloy layer on ceramic SSE interfaces were also used to modify GBs and suppress
Li dendrites at GBs.140
Some additives were also helpful to adjust the structure of GBs and inhibit Li
dendrite growth along, and penetration of GBs. Yamada et al.65 introduced
Li2CO3 and LiOH in Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12(LLZTO) to modify GBs and inhibit the
growth of Li dendrites along GBs by improving the interconnection between grains
in Figure 7B. Furthermore, adding Li6Zr2O7 in LLZTO to decompose into Li2ZrO3
during the sintering process141 and introducing lithiophilic Li3OCl into the GBs of
LLZTO were useful to fill in the gap between grains and enhance intergrain bonding,
thus inhibiting Li dendrites growth along GBs.76
Besides, the direct reduction of GBs could alleviate Li dendrite growth and delay
short-circuited time. Kataoka et al. adopted the floating zone method to prepare
a garnet type Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 without GBs and pores.142 Moreover, ionic liquid
with high ionic conductivity was investigated as to its potential to inhibit Li
dendrite growth along GBs through filling the voids within the Li7La3Zr2O12 and
coterminous GBs.
Reducing cracks and defects
Li dendrites nucleate at the cracks and defects of SSEs, and propagate through
entire SSEs, resulting in short- circuit of the battery. Therefore, it is necessary toFigure 7. Suppressing Li dendrites within SSEs

reduce cracks and defects for inhibiting Li dendrite penetration within SSEs. The
introduction of artificial interface layer and mechanical filling, and the construction
of multilayer SSEs are the main strategies.
Artificial interface layer, with good ionic conductivity, good wettability, electrical in-
sulation, and highmechanical strengthwas helpful in inhibiting cracks anddefects.143
Wen et al.133 constructed Li3PO4 layers on the surface of the Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12
as shown in Figure 7C. It was shown that the Li3PO4 layer not only promoted interfa-
cial wettability, but also provided robust interfacial phase, thus reducing the cracks
and defects to inhibit Li penetration. Furthermore, a LiPON,96 ZnO,144 Al2O3 coating
layer and Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 composite polymer coating layer66 on the interface of
SSEs could also effectively reduce cracks and defects to inhibit Li dendrites
penetration.145
Mechanical filling was another effective strategy to inhibit cracks and Li penetration.
Wang et al.146 filled perfluoromethoxy butane (HFE) into the voids of Li7P3S11. Once
Li penetrated into Li7P3S11, HFE preferential reacted with Li metal and formed LiF
interface within SSEs, which consumed Li metal and inhibited Li dendrite penetration
within SSEs. Moreover, introducing Ti4+ in Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12,
64 filling garnet
particles into polymer matrix,53 and adding silicon nanoparticles in the micropores
of Li7La3Zr2O12 effectively reduced defects and cracks to inhibit Li dendrite
penetration.81
Multilayer SSEs could combine the mechanical properties of ceramics with the flex-
ibility of polymers, thus inhibiting Li penetration. Pervez et al.147 effectively pre-
vented Li penetration by synthesizing a flexible and mechanically robust polymer
film, which consisted of Li perchlorate and garnet particles as an intermediate layer.
In addition, the introduction of sandwich-structured SSEs, such as those produced
by adding stable Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 on both surfaces of unstable Li10Ge1P2S12,
148 poly-
mer/ceramic/polymer sandwich electrolytes,149 and sandwich-type composite
SSEs (ceramic-in-polymer or polymer-in-ceramic)150 could effectively suppress Li
penetration, thus achieving dendrite-free SSEs.
Lowering electronic conductivity
High local electronic conductivity would directly reduce the overpotential of Li
nucleation within SSEs and induce Li dendrite growth in the interior of SSEs.89 There-
fore, it is necessary to lower electronic conductivity of SSEs.
Introducing an electronic insulating layer is effective in lowering the electronic conduc-
tivity of SSEs, especially at GBs. Based on the insulating property of LiF, Tang et al.134
prepared ultra-thin LiF layers with controllable thickness by vacuum evaporation
deposition, which reduced the electrical conductivity on the GBs in Li6.75La3Zr1.75
Ta0.25O12 (Figure 7D). Moreover, a coating LiAlO2 layer on the GBs of Li7La2.75
Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 could also effectively lower the electronic conductivity at GBs
and thus inhibit Li dendrites growth within SSEs.90
Electronic insulation additives could effectively lower the electronic conductivity of
SSEs. Sun et al.67 added electrically insulated LiF into the SSEs to prevent contact
between electrons and Li+, thus inhibiting Li dendrite nucleation within SSEs.
Although LiF possessed high interfacial energy and low electronic conductivity,
insufficient ionic conductivity hindered uniform Li+ transport. Therefore, simply
coating LiF on SSEs could not effectively inhibit Li dendrite growth. Based on this,
Wang et al.115 inserted Li3N with high ionic conductivity between LiF particles to16 Cell Reports Physical Science 3, 100706, January 19, 2022

OPEN ACCESSReviewprepare a composite electrolyte, which inhibited the growth of Li dendrites within
Li3PS4.
In addition, blocking electrons from entering SSEs was another useful way to inhibit
the internal growth of Li dendrites. Tian et al.124 preset an Li2PO2N interlayer on the
Li/Li7La3Zr2O12 interface, which could cut off the electronic pathway for the forma-
tion of the Li metal, thus suppressing Li dendrites within SSEs. What is more, laser
annealing was performed on the surface of Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12(LLZTO) to obtain
an amorphous LLZTO-Li2O2 composite layer, thus effectively preventing electrons
flowing into the GBs.79
Improving critical current density
According to section 2.4, critical current density (CCD) reflected the ability of SSEs to
suppress Li dendrites in the interior of SSEs.151 The related methods of improving
CCD of SSEs are listed in Table 1.67
Sakamoto et al.131 proposed that interface stability and dynamics are dependent on
variables of temperature and current density. It was found that increasing working
temperature of the battery by rapid hot-pressing technique could effectively
improve CCD (from 0.2 mA cm-2 at 70C to 3.5 mA cm-2 at 160C) of polycrystalline
Li7La3Zr2O12.
Dopants played an important role in improving CCD of SSEs. Goodenough et al.152
used Li2S6 as an additive for polyethylene oxide-based SSEs, and thus formed a sta-
ble and uniform Li2S/Li2S2 layer that inhibited Li dendrite growth within SSEs. More-
over, Li+ in Li2S6 strongly interacted with O2- in polyethylene oxide-based SSEs,
which reduced the formation of microcrystals in SSEs and improved the CCD from
0.2 to 0.9 mA cm-2. In addition, electronic insulative additives with high ionic con-
ductivity, such as LiI,153 Li3N,68 and LiF67 could also increase the CCD of SSEs. Be-
sides, adding Li4SiO4 in Al-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 by hot isostatic pressing,
154 adding
Li2.3C0.7B0.3O3 into Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12
155 and adding Mg(ClO4)2 additive into
PEO-based SSEs41 could improve the stability of the Li/SSEs interface, thus effec-
tively increasing the CCD of SSEs.
Structural optimization is also capable of bettering CCD of SSEs. Sakamoto et al.156
optimized the atomic/microstructure of SSEs by hot-press at 170C, elevating the
CCD of Li2S-P2S5 from 0.5 to 1 mA cm-2 at room temperature. Moreover, Ga-doped
Li7La3Zr2O12(LLZO) was prepared to improve the stability of cubic garnet electro-
lytes and avoid the initial propagation of Li metal in the GBs, thus increasing the
CCD of LLZO.157 Effective methods to increase CCD includes increasing the dielec-
tric constant, reducing the grain size, increasing the surface energy of the Li/SSEs
interface, reducing the interfacial dynamic resistance, and decreasing the interfacial
capacitance.111
In addition, coating mechanically stable layers such as MoS2
135, Li2CO3, and LiOH65
could effectively increase the CCD of SSEs by reducing voids and improving the
interconnection between grains as shown in Figure 7E. Pan et al.158 designed a
Li2O lithiophilic interface layer on Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (LLZTO) surface to
improve the wettability of LLZTO/Li metal interface, which effectively inhibited Li
penetration and improved the CCD from 0.5 to 1.1 mA cm-2 at 25C. Besides,
coating a Li3N/Cu hybrid conductive layer on LLZTO could also effectively improve
the CCD from 0.1 to 1.2 mA cm-2 at room temperature.159Other means
In addition to the above strategies, there are many other ways to suppress Li den-
drites within SSEs. Hu et al.69 adopted in situ neutron depth analysis, and elucidated
that short-circuit of the battery caused by Li dendrites growth in garnet-based SSEs
was a reversible condition. It was found that the deposited Li-rich phase was
consumed by the chemical reaction of the cathode or local garnet matrix, and
short-circuit of the battery would be completely or partially terminated under rest
or subjected to a discharge current. Therefore, Amin et al.136 developed an in situ
electrochemical self-repairing method by introducing a small current, which could
remove Li dendrites from the bulk phase of Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 as shown in
Figure 7F.
According to previous reported studies, stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)
could effectively inhibit Li dendrite growth at the interface of Li/solid-state electro-
lytes.16,18 Recent studies start to concentrate on building stable SEI to inhibit Li
dendrite penetration through SSEs. By comparing the origin and evolution of Li
dendrite growth within Li6.1Ga0.3La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and Li2O-Al2O3-P2O5-TiO2-
GeO2 (LATP).81 Wu et al.160 studied the failure mechanism of solid-state batteries
and demonstrated the significance of SEI in preventing Li dendrite permeation
through SSEs. Furthermore, they used Si nanoparticles to fill the surface micropores
of LLZO and formed a stable SEI to inhibit Li dendrite penetration. Additionally,
other similar solid electrolyte interphases such as LiI153, Li3N,68 and LiF161 were
found to be useful in inhibiting Li dendrite penetration through SSEs.
Moreover, the yield strength of Li metal played an effect on forming time and growth
rate of Li dendrites.92 Therefore, increasing the yield strength of SSEs could increase
the elastic modulus, thus inhibiting Li dendrite growth within SSEs.SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Utilizing nonflammable inorganic solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) holds great promise
for preventing dendrite growth and achieving safe all-solid-state Li metal batteries.
However, Li dendrites may still exist in the interior of inorganic SSEs and impede
their practical application. This review provides a systematic understanding of Li18

OPEN ACCESSReviewdendrite growth in the interior of inorganic SSEs. Combining with advanced charac-
terization techniques and theoretical calculations, theoretical models of Li dendrite
growth within SSEs is elucidated in detail, and themain causes of Li dendrites growth
within SSEs are further clarified. Furthermore, the corresponding strategies of sup-
pressing Li dendrites are comprehensively summarized (Table 2).
Based on the summary above, Li dendrite growth within SSEs is controlled by multi-
faceted factors. First, the nucleation of Li dendrites started from the initial defects
such as pores, voids, cracks, and GBs. Moreover, high relative electronic conductiv-
ity and insufficient critical current density provide a driving force for Li dendrite
growth within SSEs. Finally, Li dendrites further grow along cracks and penetrate
through SSEs, resulting in short-circuit of the battery. Accordingly, various strategies
to suppress Li dendrites mainly include: (1) increasing relative density to reduce
voids and pores, (2) modifying GBs to inhibit Li dendrites nucleation at GBs, (3)
reducing cracks and defects to prevent Li penetration, and (4) improving CCD and
lowering electron conductivity to inhibit Li dendrites formation. Furthermore, self-
repairing and other strategies are also proven methods to suppress Li dendrites
within SSEs.
Although there are numerous strategies for modifying SSEs, there is still no compre-
hensive strategy to completely suppress Li dendrites. Therefore, we recommend
that in future research, more accurate theoretical calculations are needed to reveal

OPEN ACCESS Reviewthe causes of Li dendrites within SSEs (such as shown in Figure 8). Moreover, deep-
ening fundamental understanding, using accurate in situ/operational analysis tech-
niques and constructing multidimensional mixing models combined with multiple
factors are conducive to study the causes of Li dendrite growth in the interior of
SSEs, thus providing possible pathways for effectively suppressing Li dendrites.20
In addition, modified strategies that consider multiple causes of Li dendrites within
SSEs are urgently needed. Based on the above analysis, we believe that the combi-
nation of organic SSEs and inorganic SSEs can make use of their respective advan-
tages. On the one hand, organic SSEs can eliminate pores, voids, cracks and GBs
of the Li/SSEs interface. On the other hand, inorganic SSEs can effectively improve
ionic conductivity and reduce electronic conductivity of the composite SSEs.
Through such combinations, the industrialization of the dendrite-free all-solid-state
Li metal batteries with high-energy density is just around the corner.
