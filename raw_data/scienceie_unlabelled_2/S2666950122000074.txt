 This research presents a highly sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical salinity sensor based on 
angular interrogation method for the quantification of salinity and desalination of sea water. The proposed 
salinity sensor structure composed of prism-silver (Ag)-silicon (Si)-Franckeite-sensing medium. To achieve the 
best possible performance i. e. sensitivity, detection accuracy, and quality factor, the sensor is designed and 
simulated at different wavelengths of 633 nm, 643.8 nm, 690 nm, 700 nm, and 720 nm. The performance of the 
sensor has also been optimized for different thickness of Ag layer, Si layer, and no. of layer of 2D franckeite. An 
enhanced maximum sensitivity of 305 deg./RIU is obtained with detection accuracy 0.41 deg.− 1 and quality 
factor 63.92 RIU− 1. As the sensor provides high grade of performance, this can be used as a salinity sensor for the 
desalination of seawater.   
1. Introduction 
Water salinity plays an important role in scientific research, 
including chemical and biological analysis, human lives, marine 
ecosystem protection, mineral prospecting, concrete structures health 
monitoring, etc. So, the level of salt in seawater must be measured since 
it has a significant impact on seawater organisms and under sea activ-
ities. In the traditional method, water salinity is determined by the 
electrical conductivity of chloride ions as the conductivity depends on 
the concentration of chloride ions. Interferences from other contami-
nating ions, however, impair this measuring procedure (Qian et al., 
2018). Due to electrolysis, this method is subjected to corrosion and 
current instability. In recent years, new salinity characterization 
methods based on ultrasonography or chemical reactions have been 
developed. Optical methods are based on the dependence of the 
refractive index on the concentration of salts in seawater. Nowadays, 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based salinity sensors have piqued 
researchers’ attention in this respect due to several benefits such as 
compactness, high sensitivity, lightweight, remote sensing, and so forth 
(Xia et al., 2011). 
SPR sensor operates on the basis of the attenuated total reflection 
(ATR) method. The ATR method uses a total internal reflection (TIR) 
mechanism, which causes a momentary wave known as surface plasmon 
wave (SPW). The incident light is guided through the ATR crystal to 
reflect at least off the internal surface in contact with the sensing sample. 
This reflection of the incident light beam forms the momentary wave 
extending into the sensing sample (Pumera, 2011). So, SPR is an optical 
excitation that produces a momentary electromagnetic wave that 
propagates along with the metal and dielectric material interface. It can 
be seen as an electron cloud wave that propagates along the direction of 
the metal-dielectric interface, through the contact of the freely oscil-
lating photons of the incident light with the electrons on the metal 
surface (Sharma and Pandey, 2018; Pal et al., 2021); with exponentially 
decaying electric field in metals and dielectrics. Propagation of the 
electric field and the metal-dielectric interface highly depend on the 
dielectric refractive index, thus providing high sensitivity to infinites-
imal changes in analyte refractive index. Changes in the concentration of 
biomolecules caused by chemical reactions cause changes in the 
refractive index near the sensor surface, which leads to a change in the 
propagation constant of SPW, thus, a change in SPR frequency (SPRF) 
and SPR angle take place (Homola et al., 1999). In designing SPR sen-
sors, different plasmonic materials can be used, and some suitable ap-
plicants are copper (Cu), Ag, gold (Au), etc. Among those plasmonics 
materials, Ag has outstanding optical properties, like, small optical

damping, no interband transfer at visible light frequency, sharper 
resonance peak, less broad SPR curve, etc. For this reason, it can be a 
material of choice in designing SPR sensors (Hossain et al., 2022). So, 
better sensitivity can be achieved through the use of silver as plasmonic 
material. Au is a preferred material but, it reduces detection accuracy 
due to its broader resonance curve (Kumar et al., 2020). The high 
refractive index of Si plays an important role in enhancing sensitivity; 
Transition Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) and Si based SPR sensors show 
the highest sensitivity of 147.88 deg./RIU for the WS2 layer at 633 nm 
wavelength (Ouyang et al., 2016). In 2019, Gan et al. proposed a SPR 
sensor using three layers (about 5.4 nm) of franckeite, the sensitivity 
obtained as high as 196 deg/RIU, and the corresponding figure of merit 
(FOM) is 40.29 RIU− 1 (Gan et al., 2019). Later, Srivastava et al. obtained 
a sensitivity of 208 deg/RIU, FWHM of 12 deg, quality factor (QF) of 
17.33 RIU− 1 (Srivastava and Prajapati, 2020). In 2020, Raikar et al. 
proposed a salinity sensor to measure salinity in sea water and the sensor 
provides a maximum sensitivity of 145 deg./RIU, with detection accu-
racy (DA) of 0.162 deg.− 1, and QF of 23.56 RIU− 1 (Raikwar et al., 2020). 
Rahman et al. have proposed a SPR biosensor with a sensitivity of 194 
deg./RIU with QF is calculated as 34.22 RIU− 1 for Ag based sensor and 
for Au coated sensor it is 29.39 RIU− 1 (Rahman et al., 2020). In 2020, Jia 
et al, proposed a biosensor with PtSe2 coating of 16 nm having a 
maximum sensitivity of 165 deg./RIU (Jia et al., 2020). In 2021, Rikta 
et al. proposed a biosensor having a sensitivity of 96.43 deg./RIU and QF 
of 12.36 RIU-1 (Rikta et al., 2021). Though many materials have been 
used to model SPR sensors, the recent advancement of two dimensional 
(2D) nanomaterials has taken great attention. Because of the very 
unique electronic, optical, and catalytic properties, 2D nanomaterials 
have been used extensively in sensing applications (Pal et al., 2020). 
Layered 2D materials such as graphene, blue phosphorene, and Transi-
tion metal di-chalcogenides and their heterostructures have been 
explored by the scientific community to enhance the SPR sensor per-
formance for gas and bio sensing application (Srivastava and Prajapati, 
2020; Pal et al., 2020). Recently, various artificial stacking hetero-
structures like graphene based heterostructure, BlueP/MoS2 have been 
reported for SPR based sensing and significant enhancement observed in 
sensitivity (Hossain et al., 2022; Srivastava and Prajapati, 2019, 2020). 
The idea of forming van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures (Peng et al., 
2016) by integrating various two-dimensional materials breaks the 
limitation of the restricted properties of single material systems. One 
approach to produce such heterostructures is to use epitaxially grown 
materials assembled sheet by sheet (Bae et al., 2010). This method, 
however, remains challenging and has only been demonstrated for a few 
van der Waals heterostructures so far (Zhang et al., 2014). Another 
approach is the manual assembly of individual layers obtained by me-
chanical exfoliation from bulk and the deterministic placement of one 
layer on top of another. While the sensitivity of the biosensor based on 
these artificially designed heterostructure(s) can be high, it is not easy to 
control the lattice orientations. Consequently, undesired atmospheric 
adsorbates between the layers occur (Molina-Mendoza et al., 2017). On 
the other hand, naturally occurring layered minerals such as Franckeite 
(member of the sulfosalt family), which is alternating stacks of PbS-like 
pseudotetragonal (Q) layer and SnSe-like pseudohexagonal (H) layer, 
are found to possess naturally VDW superlattices, and it is free from 
surface contaminations in contrast to the artificially designed hetero-
structure(s). In recently, Velický et al. obtained the single layer heter-
ostructure (thickness about 1.8 nm) by mechanical and liquid-phase 
exfoliation of franckeite (Zhu et al., 2013). Franckeite is a 2-dimensional 
p-type, air stable material which is a very rare feature in 2D semi-
conductors, and it can be exfoliated into layers mechanically (Zhu et al., 
2013); also it is free from surface contaminations in contrast to the 
artificially designed heterostructure(s). It has a very narrow band gap of 
less than 0.7 eV. Due to its narrow band gap and its naturally occurring 
Vander walls heterostucture, it enhances electric field in its interfaces 
and increases sensitivity. That is why we have used this 2D Franckeite as 
a guiding layer. 
One of the most challenging global issues in the 21st century is the 
scarcity of clean water. Climate change, rapid population growth, and 
rapid urbanization, directly account for freshwater inadequacy on our 
planet (Lee et al., 2016). Around half of the world’s population lives 
close to oceans that cover 80% of the earth’s water supply. Desalination 
of seawater seems to unravel the world’s water shortage issues, partic-
ularly within the zones where ground or spring water isn’t accessible 
(Dutta et al., 2016; Oki and Kanae, 2006; Wang et al., 2017). The ocean 
provides water, which is about 96.5% of all the earth’s water is natural, 
but not potable due to salinity (Xu et al., 2019). Salinity is defined as the 
concentration of dissolved mineral salts present in waters and soils. 
Salinity also affects coping agriculture (Elimelech, 2006). The average 
salinity of standard seawater is 35% at 0 ◦C (Etesami et al., 2019; Adamo 
et al., 2015). For water to be taken as a drink, its salinity must be 
reduced because high salinity has an adverse effect on all living organ-
isms. For measuring the salinity of seawater, different methods are used 
like conductivity sensor, refractometry sensor. Based on the measure-
ment of the refractive index of seawater (Shannon et al., 2009); it has 
been shown that the absolute salinity can be accurately assessed because 
the refractive index of seawater is directly related to the medium density 
(ρ). In point of the fact that all the physical properties of seawater are 
derived from salinity (S), pressure (P) and temperature (T) (Shannon 
et al., 2009). These can be applied to density with the following equation 
of International State of Seawater, density, ρ = f(S,T,P) (SCOR/IAPSO, 
2007). 
As in the SPR sensor, a change in analyte refractive index results in a 
change of the local refractive index of the sensor surface; this change 
will eventually change the propagation constant of the SPW, resulting in 
a shift in the SPR angle. Changing in this parameter (SPR angle) can be 
used to sense the degree of salinity of seawater. In (Raikwar et al., 2020), 
Surjeet Raikwar et al. measured the seawater concentration using SPR 
based salinity sensor. They obtained impressive results. But this can be 
improved further by incorporating the advancement of 2D materials in 
bimolecular and environmental element sensing, so the design of highly 
sensitive sensors becomes easier. Franckeite is a newly synthesized 2D 
material and can be peeled off into layers (Velický et al., 2017). It is an 
air-stable material, thus less vulnerable to oxidation, and has a crystal-
line structure. The energy band gap for franckeite is less than 0.7 eV. 
These features make it an alternative material for black phosphorous 
(BP) and graphene. The use of franckeite nanosheet in optoelectronic 
devices has a pronounced prospective (Velický et al., 2017; Ray et al., 
2017). 
This research work aims to design an SPR based optical sensor that

can be used as a salinity sensor to sense sea water salinity with a high 
degree of sensitivity. As temperature and pressure change, the refractive 
index of seawater also changes (Baker, 2012; Rosen, 1947). This study is 
done by considering a constant temperature of 20 ◦C and pressure at 0 
kg/cm2 (Elimelech, 2006). 
2. Methodology 
2.1. Design consideration and theoretical modeling 
Fig. 1 depicts our designed five-layer SPR sensor based on typical 
Kretschmann configuration. This proposed sensor is prism coupled and 
uses angular interrogation techniques (Homola et al., 1999). The 
transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light of different wavelengths inci-
dent at one end of the prism and an optical detector receives the re-
flected optical signal. 
Prism is responsible for wave vector matching, which is important 
for SPR condition to occur. BK7 prism has a low refractive index and, 
easier to manufacture (Kusko, 2012). Here, prism acts as a base layer. 
The prism is coated with Ag having a layer thickness, dAg = 50 nm, 
which in turn covered by a Si layer of thickness, dsi = 5 nm, and then by 
a layer of 2D franckeite nanosheet having a thickness, df = L ∗ 1.8 nm 
where L represents number of franckeite layers and takes integer values 
of 0,1,2,3, etc. The refractive indices of different layers are considered as 
follows. The first layer is BK7 prism, its refractive index can be calcu-
lated using Eq. (1). 
nBK7 =

where λ is the wavelength of incident light. The values of the constants,

0.0060006986, 0.020017914, and 103.56065 respectively (Karki et al., 
2021). The complex refractive index of Ag layer can be expressed using 
Drude model, nAg =

, where collision wave-
length, λc = 17.614 μm and plasma wavelength, λp = 0.14541μm 
(Brahmachari and Ray, 2013). Similarly, the refractive index for Si is 
taken from this work (Ghosh and Ray, 2015). The complex refractive 
index of franckeite with L*1.8 nm thickness has been taken from the 
experimental measurement (Gant et al., 2017). The refractive index of 
the sensing medium is considered as ns = 1.33 + Δns; where Δns in-
dicates the change in the refractive index of the sensing medium caused 
by biochemical or bimolecular interaction (Jia et al., 2020). 
In this proposed design, using the Si layer between Ag and franckeite 
enhances sensitivity as it accelerates the mobility of electrons in 
franckeite responsible for efficient sensing of analytes at the sensor 
surface (Kumar et al., 2020). 
In our work, saline water with a salinity of 1% to 30% and pure water 
are considered as analytes in the sensing layer. Refractive indices of 
saline water correspond to different salinity are taken from (Austin and 
Halikas, 1976). To simulate our proposed sensor and to evaluate its 
performance, “COMSOL multiphysics” platform is used with a maximum 
mesh element size of 0.0581 μm and that of minimum mesh element size 
of 2.18× 10− 4μm. Fig. 2 shows that an excitation of TM polarized light is 
provided on the BK7 prism. We have used a parametric sweep for 
angular interrogation of the incident light from 60⁰ to 89.98⁰ with an 
increment of 0.02⁰. Propagation of z component of surface magnetic 
field is shown in Fig. 3 at SPR angle of 82.86◦ (resonance condition) for 
sample refractive index of 1.33175 and Fig. 4 shows propagation of z 
component of surface magnetic field at non SPR angle 64.5◦ (non- 
resonance condition) for sample refractive index of 1.33175. It is clearly 
observed from both figures that the distribution of magnetic field is 
maximum at SPR angle and SPW propagates along metal dielectric 
interface.

sensor and its deposition techniques are discussed. Ag can be deposited 
on BK7 substrate using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method 
(Boehm et al., 2011). Si can be deposited on top of the Ag layer by the 
CVD method (Matsumura and Tachibana, 1985). Spin coating deposi-
tion technique can be used for franckeite deposition on top of Si layer 
(Garcia-Basabe et al., 2021). A cuvette can be mounted on the sensor 
chip to provide a passage for seawater to detect its concentration. The 
salinity level of seawater can be varied from 1% to 30% at a constant 
temperature of 20◦C, poured into the cuvette, for loading next salinity 
seawater, the previous concentration was denaturized (Raikwar et al., 
2020). 
2.2. Mathematical modeling for reflectivity 
The measurement of reflected light intensity at the prism side is 
required for the sensing purpose of this SPR sensor, and the intensity of 
reflection of TM polarized light can be expressed as follows (Hossain 
et al., 2022; Maurya et al., 2015)

dent light.

2.3. Mathematical modeling of the performance parameters 
The performance parameter of the proposed sensor is characterized 
on the basis of its sensitivity, quality factor, and detection accuracy . A 
good sensor is one that shows high sensitivity, high detection accuracy, 
and quality factor simultaneously (). The sensitivity of the sensor is 
defined as the shift of SPR angle (ΔθSPR) to the change in refractive index 
(RI) of the sensing medium (Δns) and its unit is deg./RIU. 
Mathematically sensitivity (S) can be given by (Verma et al., 2015),

3. Results and discussions 
The performance of the proposed sensor is evaluated and compared 
these evaluating parameters with the earlier reported works. The per-
formance parameters are analyzed at different wavelength of the inci-
dent light. Reflectivity curves are plotted in Fig. 5 for wavelengths of 
633 nm, 643.8 nm, 690 nm, 700 nm, and 720 nm. It is seen from the 
figures that maximum sensitivity is obtained at 633 nm wavelength. 
During the simulation, the RI of the sensing medium is taken from pure 
water (RI 1.330) to a change in salinity from 1% to 30%. For each 
wavelength and RI of the sensing medium, a dip of SPR curve occurs, 
and the reflectance intensity becomes minimum, the angle of incident 
light for which the reflectance intensity dip takes place is known as the 
SPR angle. Performance parameters at different wavelengths using the 
SPR curve are tabulated in Table 1. It’s been observed in Table 1 that the 
maximum sensitivity obtained at 633 nm wavelength is 305 deg./RIU 
and minimum sensitivity is 298 deg./RIU, for 643.8 nm wavelength, 
280 deg./RIU and 269 deg./RIU, for 690 nm wavelength 174.88 deg./ 
RIU and 150.37 deg./RIU, for 700 nm wavelength, 171 deg./RIU and 
168 deg./RIU, and for 720 nm wavelength, 158.31 deg./RIU and 148.57 
deg./RIU respectively. It is also observed from Table 1 that sensitivity 
increases from 298 to 305 deg./RIU for 633 nm, 269 to 281 deg./RIU for 
643.8 nm, 150.37 deg./RIU to 171.67 deg./RIU,168 to 171 deg./RIU for 
700 nm, and 144.9 to 158.31 deg./RIU for 720 nm wavelength. Sensi-
tivity increases beacuase a small change in salinity of seawater causes 
the position of resonance angle to shift to a higher value. In our work, 
maximum sensitivity of 305 deg./RIU is obtained at 633 nm wavelength, 
and sensitivity becomes minimum, 144.9 deg./RIU at 720 nm; this is due 
to the fact that change in SPR angle, ΔθSPR is maximum 2.1◦ for 633 nm 
wavelength, and minimum 0.78◦ at 720 nm wavelength. The reduced 
effective light coupling to SPW results in low sensitivity at higher 
wavelengths (Qian et al., 2018). Fig. 6 displays the variation of sensi-
tivity and DA with the change in RI of seawater. It can be observed from 
Fig. 6 that DA increases with the increasing of wavelength from 0.186 
deg.− 1 at 633 nm to 0.41 deg.− 1 at 720 nm wavelength. At a higher 
wavelength, ohmic loss reduces, and thus detection accuracy improves 
as SPR curves become less broad (Nelson et al., 1999). The broadening of 
SPR curve is connected to the franckeite band gap which is less than 0.7 
eV, and ohmic loss associated with metal (Ag). Refractive index of 
metals and dielectrics are connected to the wavelength of incident light. 
With an increase in wavelength, the real part of the complex refractive 
index of franckeite increases and imaginary part decreases, this 
decreasing imaginary part i.e. extinction coefficient causes smaller 
damping to the SPR curve and the curves become sharper for 700 nm 
wavelength as compared to 633 nm wavelength. In the SPR measure-
ments, broadening of reflectivity curves is generally caused either by 
absorption at the used wavelength or by the roughness of the deposited 
film. The broadness of the SPR curves at 633 nm wavelength originates 
from the strong absorption of light at this wavelength. The less widening 
of SPR curve is attributed to the low absorption of light at 700 nm 
wavelength. Ohmic loss associated with metals depends on the wave-
length of incident light. The reason of SPR curve being less widen, is 
attributed to the fact that at the higher wavelength, the ohmic loss in the 
metals is relatively low, thereby exhibiting sharper SPR curves (Pumera, 
2011). The proposed sensor has been simulated for different wavelength 
of light i.e. 633 nm, 643.8 nm, 690 nm, 700 nm, and 720 nm and the 
simulated data are tabulated in Table 1. From Table 1, it is seen that with 
an increasing operating wavelength, DA, and QF increase, and it’s been

also observed that the sensitivity decreases. From Table 1, it is seen that, 
from 700 nm to 720 nm wavelength, there is a little improvement in QF 
and DA by sacrificing huge amount sensitivity in return of those im-
provements. Considering all the parameters, we can choose, 700 nm as 
an optimal wavelength of light as it provides an optimal performance. 
Fig. 7 shows the variation of QF and sensitivity with the variation of 
RI of seawater at wavelengths of 633 nm, 643.8 nm, 690 nm, 700 nm, 
and 720 nm. It is observed that though the highest sensitivity of 305 
deg./RIU is obtained at 633 nm, the highest QF is obtained at 700 nm 
wavelength. At lower wavelength, SPR curves become broader, resulting 
in lower QF, DA, and at higher wavelength curves becomes less broad-
ening. For seawater RI of 1.33175–1.33699, QF varies from 47 to 52 
RIU− 1, 45 RIU− 1, 47.44 RIU− 1 to 54.72 RIU− 1, 56 to 60 RIU− 1, and 
56.85 RIU− 1 to 63.92 RIU − 1 for 633 nm, 643.8 nm, 690 nm, 700 nm,

and 720 nm respectively. 
Fig. 8 displays sensitivity variation to the number of franckeite 
layers. The highest sensitivity is obtained with a single franckeite layer i. 
e. when L = 1. Fig. 9 displays the sensitivity of the proposed sensor with 
the variation of Si layer thickness. As shown in the figure, the optimized 
thickness for Si is 5 nm. With Si layer, maximum sensitivity obtained is 
305 deg./RIU for 5 nm thickness of Si layer. Without Si layer, maximum 
sensitivity becomes 172 deg./RIU. Si layer enhances sensitivity as it 
increases the mobility of electrons in franckeite responsible for sensing 
analytes efficiently at its surface (Karki et al., 2021). 
From Table 2, it is seen that a maximum sensitivity of 298 deg./RIU 
is obtained for 50 nm thickness of Ag layer with a reflectance intensity of 
21.286 a.u. For a 45 nm of Ag, the sensitivity obtained is 274.28 deg./ 
RIU and for 55 nm of Ag layer, the sensitivity obtained is 297.14 deg./ 
RIU with a reflectance intensity of 41.9286 a.u for an analyte refractive 
index of 1.33175. With a 55 nm thickness of the Ag layer, the reflectance 
intensity becomes 55.59 a.u for an analyte refractive index of 1.33699. 
So, considering all this, we have chosen an optimized Ag layer thickness

of 50 nm as it provides optimized performance. In Fig. 10, we have 
shown sensitivity versus thickness curves for the Ag layer. 
In the proposed work, performance parameters are calculated using 
simulation data obtained from FEM based ‘COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS’ 
platform. The performance parameters can also be calculated using 
transfer matrix method (TMM). In Table 3, a comparison of performance 
parameters using FEM, and TMM is provided. 
Table 4 shows the comparison of the proposed work with the earlier 
reported works. From the table it is seen that on the basis of perfor-
mance, the designed sensors outperforms previously reported works. 
4. Conclusion 
This work describes a highly sensitive prism-coupled SPR based 
optical salinity sensor that is simulated and analyzed theoretically uti-
lizing franckeite nanosheets, a newly developed 2D material. The 
designed sensor has been optimized in terms of thicknesses of franck-
neite, Ag, and Si layer. To achieve the best possible performance i. e. 
sensitivity, detection accuracy, and quality factor, the sensor is designed 
and simulated at different wavelengths of 633 nm, 643.8 nm, 640 nm, 
700 nm, and 720 nm. Here, the sensor is designed to measure the salinity 
of seawater. The proposed sensor exhibits enhanced sensitivity, quality 
factor, and detection accuracy than the previously reported works. The 
sensitivity of the conventional SPR sensor enhances with the addition of 
Si and franckeite layer as the absorption efficiency of franckeite is 
higher, and the Si enhances the mobility of the electrons in franckeite 
responsible for efficient sensing of analytes in the sensing medium. The 
optimized sensor provides a maximum sensitivity of 305 deg./RIU, 
detection accuracy of 0.41 deg.− 1, and quality facor of 63.92 RIU− 1. 
Performance parameters i.e. sensitivity, detection accuracy, and quality 
factor are enhanced to a great extent in comparison with the earlier 
reported works. The raised sensor could be accomplished by utilizing the 
available fabrication technologies. As the proposed sensor provides 
promising results, this could be applied to measure the salinity of 
seawater.
