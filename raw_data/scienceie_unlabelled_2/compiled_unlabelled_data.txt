According to the CFD simulation results ,   it was explained that this high desulfurization is due to the higher hy- drodynamic momentum ratio ( momentum of ultrasonic jet - like   streaming / momentum of the aqueous phase injected by the nozzle ) as   well as secondarily , further oxidation reactions of DBT derivatives with   oxidizing radicals ( HO2⋅ , O⋅ and HO⋅ ) in the active zone just below the   probe tips not only when larger - diameter ( 1.5 mm ) nozzles are used   instead of 0.4- and 0.9-mm - diameter nozzles but also when each of the   aqueous phase flow rates is lower ( using two nozzles with an aqueous   phase flow rate of 24.45 mL min− 1 each instead of using a single nozzle   with the aqueous phase flow rate of 48.89 mL min− 1 ) .

Machine learning is a fundamental procedure for data mining processes as it generates smart algorithms capable of dis- covering patterns and information in data bases automatically , which aid decision making [ 5]. Cluster analysis is a data mining process which consists in dividing the samples into groups ( clusters ) based on information found within the data which describes these samples and its rela- tionships [ 35]. Samples belonging to the same cluster must show a similarity pattern among them while being as dissimilar as possi- ble from samples associated to other clusters .

Ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy ( UV - PAM ) is a label - free im- aging modality that can generate histological images of biological tissue   surface without physical sectioning [ 28]. By the intrinsic optical ab- sorption contrast , UV laser illumination has the advantage of high- lighting cell nuclei with cytoplasm serving as the background , thus   providing a similar contrast as H&E labeling used in conventional his- tology [ 29]. Unlike nonlinear microscopy , UV - PAM is not demanding in   the system configuration while providing subcellular resolution .

In addition , it was shown that the increase of   the aqueous phase flow rate from 10 to 40 mL min− 1 for all the nozzle   diameters leads to a decrease in desulfurization due to the reason   mentioned above .
These increases in defect density which can cause a change in the lattice parameters of ZnO , also results in the non - linear behavior of electrical conductivity .

However , the standard   reduction potential [ 243 ] of ferrate in acidic medium is + 2.20 V. With   the excessive use of TOAB , the sulfur removal decreased , which has been   attributed to the slowing of mass transfer due to turbidity of the mixture   and to sterically prevention of electrophilic oxidation of sulfur com- pounds by the high concentration of alkyl groups .

Medical devices and pharmaceuticals are typically subjected to   sterilization processes to ensure patient safety [ 1–4]. A Sterility Assur- ance Level ( SAL ) of 10− 6 is currently required for these processes ,   meaning that the device or product can contain no more than one viable   microorganism per one million sterilized items , before these can come in   contact with patients in order to ensure that the products are safe [ 5].

In a study [ 179 ] conducted to remove   sulfur from a straight run diesel oil sample containing 960 ppm S ( fol- lowed by extraction one time with DMF at extractant / oil volume ratio of   1:2 ) , a desulfurization yield of 94.7 % was obtained at the optimum   conditions ( HP / formic acid ( FA ) 1 : 1 vol ratio , ( HP + FA)/oil 1:10 vol   ratio , 50 ◦ C and 10 min ) under 28 kHz–40 kHz and max 200 W direct US .  
The histogram of   grayvalues within this volume is determined and approximated by three   normal distributions .
It was found that the   sulfur removal efficiencies achieved at 1.8 bar for all three catalysts   were lower than the desulfurization performances at atmospheric pres- sure , mainly due to the reduction in microconvection intensity within   the mixture under high pressure , resulting in lower mass transport .

In practice , however , when the spectral radius ρ(A ) is   close to 1 , i.e. the VAR model is nearly unstable ,
/ ce− ≈ 2RTκe− SEI
o technologies like the internet and mobile phones help to overcome hese disadvantages ?   .
Following that , the results were sent o locate and select regions of interest ( ROIs ) in the Digital Imaging and ommunications in Medicine ( DICOM ) images with bounding boxes .  
Assessing causality between time series data is of particular interest when neuro- monitoring indices are derived from those time series and causal interaction between them is assumed .
If more tests for GC are performed on the same dataset , e.g. bidirectional   GC testing ( Y→X and X→Y ) or more pairs of variables , it is advised to apply a correction for multiple comparisons [ 25].  
The best number of clusters can be estimated by computing the average weigth of the silhouettes designed for a range of partitions with different numbers of clusters .
Moreover , a coating LiAlO2 layer on the GBs of Li7La2.75 Ca0.25Zr1.75Nb0.25O12 could also effectively lower the electronic conductivity at GBs and thus inhibit
k time lots of length

In Figure 5 , all PDD values are normalized by the   IAEA experimental data .
owever , this is examined in the literature and our experiences onfirm findings that first - hand experiences are crucial for the nderstanding of VR / AR .
In our approach , GC in each   data segment was estimated independently of previous data .
Therefore , in consideration of the effects of Li nucleation at GBs and interfa- cial resistance , a density - driven stabilization mechanism was developed to better predict the Li penetration within inorganic
It was stated that this calculated cost will be less in   continuous - flow UAODS systems as there are stagnant zones in the   mixture in batch UAODS systems , thus leading to a higher consumption   of US power density per unit volume of fuel in the batch systems .
– electronmi- croscopy equipped with valence state electron energy - loss spectroscopy were utilized to prove that electrons provided by the narrow band gap of GBs were confirmed to easily reduce Li+ to Li dendrites within SSEs , leading to short - circuit of the battery as shown in Figure 5H.80 Theoretical models
Overall , this study demonstrated annotated text and text with embedded emotion were   more likely to be judged as deceptive than plain text .
HT1080 cells were grown to confluent on 6 well plate and transfected with smartpool siRNAs that target PLD1 and PLD2 respectively at four different sequences using Dharmafect transfection reagent ( set 4 ) .
