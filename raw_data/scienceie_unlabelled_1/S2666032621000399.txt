We consider quantum transition amplitudes, partition functions and observables for 3D spin foam models
within 𝑆𝑈 (2) quantum group deformation symmetry, where the deformation parameter is postulated to be a
complex fifth root of unity. By considering fermionic cycles through the foam, we couple this 𝑆𝑈 (2) quantum
group with the same deformation of 𝑆𝑈 (3) so that we have quantum numbers linked with spacetime symmetry
and charge gauge symmetry in the computation of observables. In this case, the amplitudes have a polytope
interpretation. The generalization to higher-dimensional Lie groups 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁), 𝐺2 and 𝐸8 is suggested.1. Introduction
Quantum gravity and unification physics programs, in the absence
of more concrete experimental results, rely much on rigorous mathe-
matical results to make progress. The well established quantum gravity
programs of loop quantum gravity (LQG) [1] and string theory [2,3] are
good examples of this new paradigm to find clues about the underlying
physics at the Planck scale. For a review of the motivations and main
results of LQG and spin foam models we recommend the book [1].
We also recommend a review of the main elements of the higher
dimensional Lie algebra unification program [4–8], which is closely
related to string theory. With these results as guides, this paper will
construct a model where quantum numbers associated to quantum
geometry or spacetime symmetry in usual 𝑆𝑈 (2) spin foam models in
3D are coupled with eigenvalues of operators from higher dimensional
Lie algebras, which can be associated to ‘‘charge’’ quantum numbers.
This is done by defining 3D topological observables.
It is interesting to point out that LQG starts from general relativity
and provides its quantization, which leads to the quantization of the
geometry itself; lengths, areas and volumes, in operator form, have dis-
crete spectra; they have minimum quanta. But it does not incorporate
matter and the quantum fields — the charge space symmetries. On the
other side, string theory starts from the quantum fields and implements
the generalization from point particles to extended particles, like a one
dimensional string or the higher dimensional branes. This also leads
to discrete spectra, and a more complete description of unification
physics. But this unification picture is more complicated because the
strings are defined over a spacetime manifold, which leads to funda-
mental problems and the search for a more fundamental (𝑀−)theory,

1 Note that the 𝑆𝑈 (3) group can be connected both with gauge field as with fermions. The gauge fields are usually modeled in the adjoint representation and
the fermions in the fundamental representation. In our case one can expect that if we go back from the spin foam state sum transition amplitudes to the action
level, we should get actions for both the gauge fields and fermions.
where ‘‘one hopes to understand the existence of a spacetime manifold
itself as the emergent property of a specific vacuum rather than an
identifiable feature of the underlying theory’’ [3]. A partner approach
of string theory, but less ambitious, is the Lie algebraic unification
program, as in 𝐸8 unification [9,10]. This makes use of the gen-
eralization of the simplest non-abelian gauge symmetry, 𝑆𝑈 (2), to
higher-dimensional ones, ending with a complete unification of the
charge Lie group symmetries of the standard model in the largest
exceptional Lie algebra 𝐸8, making heavy use of the representation
theory of these algebras. Our aim is to use this unification aspect of
the representation theory of Lie algebras in connection to the spin foam
approach of LQG. We can say that spin foam partition functions or
transition amplitudes are about the interaction of representations of
spacetime symmetry, and so, ultimately, 𝐸8 can provide the network
of interaction representations incorporating the usual charge symme-
tries — but here we focus on the first step in 3 dimensions where
spacetime symmetry is just 𝑆𝑈 (2) and internal charge symmetry is
chosen to be 𝑆𝑈 (3). We also provide a polytope interpretation for the
representations of charge symmetry in the spin foam network1.
Both the LQG and string/M-theory programs lead to the idea of
building blocks for all the fields that constitute our classical and quan-
tum worlds, from which the question arises of how to ‘‘glue’’ these
fundamental blocks together in an elementary and first-principles way.
There have been recent efforts to use the idea of entanglement in both
approaches [11,12].
In the model we develop here, the building blocks are very con-
strained where there is a small set of Lie algebra representations that
interact, and the syntax of its fusion rules works as a glue, indicating
topological order [13,14]. With a tetrahedron building block the prob-
lem is translated to an issue of how to tile the space, where we will
be mainly concerned with 3-dimensional space, which can be linked
with the Fibonacci anyonic fusion Hilbert space, which is one of our
motivations to choose the specific fifth root of unity deformation of Lie
algebras. In this way we propose the fifth root of unity deformation as
our postulate for quantization of geometry in 3D, which also simplifies
the computation of transition amplitudes and observables.
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we present the
fifth root of unity quantization postulate for geometry in 3D and its
associated Fibonacci fusion Hilbert space interpretation. In Section 3
we discuss the coupling of the model with internal 𝑆𝑈 (3) symmetries
and suggest a natural extension to the larger 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁), 𝐺2, and 𝐸8, with
the same fifth root of unity deformation. In this constrained framework,
we are able to explicitly calculate some observables and the amplitudes
— our main result. We also discuss the polytope interpretation of the
amplitudes. We present our conclusions in Section 4. In Appendix A we
review the usual concept of 3D spin foam quantum gravity, and present
its modified topological regularized version based on the Turaev and
Viro model. In Appendix B we present a review of the grand unification
physics program.
2. 3D Spin foam and quantum groups at the fifth root of unity
We review the usual spin foam models and its q-deformation regu-
larization in Appendix A. Here we propose to derive the large spin tran-
sition amplitude discussed in the appendix from the direct quantization
of geometry, in particular a quantum building block, a tetrahedron,
following the notion of quantum tetrahedrons [15] as a quantization
postulate for geometry. It is well known that in 3D gravity only has
topological degrees of freedom. We postulate the topological fifth root
of unity symmetry, to be discussed below, as the quantization postulate
in 3D and discuss that it implies a topological quantum computer
picture of pre-spacetime.
2.1. The quantum tetrahedron with topological symmetry
The quantization of one tetrahedron allows us to define and ad-
dress the quantization of geometric quantities like lengths, areas and
volumes. Yet the usual quantization with 𝑆𝑈 (2) symmetry is much
too general, allowing divergences for these geometric quantities. A
kind of regularization can be done by implementing restrictions on the
representation theory of Lie algebras — the usual deformation of the
classical algebra with a complex root of unity parameter.
Let us discuss a specific model implementation. Most of the geo-
metric quantities of interest such as lengths, areas and volumes can
be described in a simple, unifying form from the geometry of the 3-
simplex, the tetrahedron. The tetrahedron can be described by its 4
(outgoing) normals, vectors 𝐋𝑎 in its four triangular faces, 𝑎 = 1, 2, 3, 4,
ubject to the closure constraint
=

∑
𝑎=1
𝐋𝑎 = 0. (1)
ll geometric properties of the tetrahedron can be derived from the
ormals and must be invariant under a common 𝑆𝑂(3) rotation of the
etrahedron. For example, the area of face 𝑎 is given by 𝐴𝑎 = |𝐋𝑎|
nd the volume is defined by 𝑉 2 = 2

⋅ 𝐋3. The proposed
uantizing postulate is a quantum deformation of Eq. (A.2). Eq. (A.2) is
he 𝑆𝑈 (2) algebra implied by the 3 dimensional rotational symmetry,
here the normals are promoted to operators 𝐿𝑎 and identified with
he generators of the algebra 𝐿𝑖
𝑎 (𝑖 = 1, 2, 3). We first write the classical
lgebra in terms of Cartan generators and root vectors, which are the2
sual ladder operators of 𝑆𝑈 (2), then choose the Cartan generator𝑎 = 𝐿3
𝑎 and the root vectors 𝐿±𝛼

we should implement a more fundamental topological symmetry. So
we apply the 𝑆𝑈 (2)𝑞 deformation at the fifth root of unity 𝑞 = 𝑒

with 𝑟 = 5 (from now on let us call it 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞), which affects the Cartan

For this deformation to be dimensionally consistent, we start with
everything adimensional and there is no need a priori for 𝛽. There is a
notion of scale incorporated in the deformation parameter, 𝑟 = 𝑙𝑐
𝑙𝑝
, with
𝑟 an integer and the large scale 𝑙𝑐 given in units of the underlying scale
𝑙𝑝. This representation theory is as well understood as that of 𝑆𝑈 (2).

5. When 𝑋𝑎 and 𝑌𝑎 have
zero eigenvalues for all vectors in the linear vector space carrying the
irreducible representation, the representations have classical analogs,
and can be constructed by specializing from the general values of 𝑞 to
the specific root of unity. In this case the spin quantum numbers that
label the representations of 𝑆𝑈 (2)𝑞 are constrained to 𝑗𝑎 ≤ 3
2 , and are
related to the Casimir 𝐶𝑎𝑞 of eigenvalues [𝑗𝑎]𝑞[(𝑗𝑎+1)]𝑞 . In this way the
area spectrum interpretation
𝐴𝑎 =

is not immediate and a scale should emerge in an appropriate limit.
The vertex amplitude is naturally given by the specialization of
Eq. (A.6) to 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 symmetry defined by the Hilbert space of the tensor
roduct of 4 representations at the vertex 𝐻𝑗𝑞1 ×𝐻𝑗𝑞2 ×𝐻𝑗𝑞3 ×𝐻𝑗𝑞4 , and
it is a function of the representations on the 6 boundary faces defined

𝑗’s in 0, 1∕2, 1, 3∕2, are all null except for a small set of combinations,
which can be computed from Eq. (18) restricted to the 𝑆𝑈 (2) case and

More generally, this kind of amplitude is independent of the trian-
gulation, and gives a topological invariant as described in the Turaev
and Viro model [17], which means that it does not depend on the
triangulation inside the 3 manifold, but depends only on the edge
values and on the topology of the triangulated 3 manifold (the number
of punctures on the boundary 2-sphere). Exploiting the possibility to
build invariants by fixing the representations labels on the edges we
can consider networks of these topological amplitudes, which act as
building blocks for decomposing a higher dimensional tensor product
space, which we will motivate more in the next section. For example,
we can consider amplitudes, functions of representations on boundary
faces of edges for closed loops along the 3 dimensional spin foam

where 𝑐 is a closed loop across the 3 dimensional triangulation and
𝑗𝑙𝑐 = 𝑗1,… , 𝑗𝑛 are the representations on the boundary faces of the 𝑛
edges contained in 𝑐. The sum ∑
𝑗𝑓 |𝑗𝑙𝑐
is taken while maintaining those
boundary faces of the edges of 𝑐 fixed. The notation with the sum and
roducts in Eq. (8) is to indicate that one needs to use all possible
onfigurations allowed.
.2. Motivation for the fifth root: Fibonacci fusion Hilbert space
We now consider the topological data of 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 . The admissible
pin representations are 𝑗 = 0, 12 , 1,
3
2 , and their quantum dimension are
given by
𝑑𝑞𝑗 = 𝑠𝑖𝑛

1⊗ 1 = 0⊕ 1. (10)
Remember that a segment of the triangulation is dual to a face on the
dual 2-complex where there is attached a representation of 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 .
Fundamentally there are 2 states on the segments, one with quantum
dimension 1 and one with quantum dimension 𝜙, and we have a notion
of a 2-dimensional fusion Hilbert space [13,14] as the superposition
of these 2 states. The space 𝐻𝑗𝑞1 × 𝐻𝑗𝑞2 × 𝐻𝑗𝑞3 is in this way 3-
dimensional and is related to the triangular faces. The tetrahedron
𝐻𝑗𝑞1 × 𝐻𝑗𝑞2 × 𝐻𝑗𝑞3 × 𝐻𝑗𝑞4 is 5 dimensional. The dimensions grow with
the increasing number of representations, following the well known
Fibonacci sequence, which gives the name of Fibonacci anyons for
the representations of the 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 symmetry in context of topological
phases of matter and quantum computing fields of researches. In this
language the 𝐴𝑣 = 𝑊 5
△1
(𝑗𝑙𝑣) building block amplitude is just the known
F symbol that appears in those anyonic models [13,14]. The partition
function is about gluing these 𝐴𝑣 amplitudes, which makes sense from
the point of view of quantum computation. An important result in
the field of quantum computation is that a higher dimensional Hilbert
space can be decomposed into a network of qubits and 2-level quantum
gates [18], and that with at least 3 Fibonacci anyon representations,
one can implement the qubits, where the braids of these anyons can
approximate any 2-level quantum gate, making Fibonacci anyons a
sufficient substrate for universal quantum computation [13]. It has
been shown that anyons described by Chern–Simons theory at some
root of unity 𝑟 can give rise to universal quantum computation for 𝑟 = 5
or 𝑟 > 7 [13,19]. So 𝑍𝑞(𝑛𝑗) of 𝑛 ‘‘anyon states’’, for large 𝑛, can be
understood as a topological quantum computer but described by the3

(𝑗𝑙𝑣). The dual 2-
omplex of the quantum tetrahedron is made of one vertex in the bulk
nd 4 nodes on the triangular boundary faces of the triangulation. The
uantum tetrahedron carries 4 anyonic charges, the 4-tensor product
f the 𝐻𝑗𝑞𝑖 above, implemented by 𝐴𝑣. The extension of the topological
ata from 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 to 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁)𝑟𝑞 is presented in the next section.
. Fermionic cycles and gauge symmetry unification
The natural symmetry for the quantum tetrahedron, as discussed
n Section 2.1, is the spatial rotations 𝑆𝑂(3) in 3D, implemented by
he covering group 𝑆𝑈 (2), and hence its fifth-root-of-unity deforma-
ion. But the generalization of 𝑆𝑈 (2) = 𝐴1 in the Weyl–Cartan or
hevalley basis to the higher dimensional simple Lie algebras, Eq. (B.6),
ndicates that we can incorporate the so called internal symmetry or
harge space in the same way. The simplest way is to consider the
ymmetry 𝑆𝑈 (2) × 𝐺, with 𝐺 one of the higher dimensional simple
ie algebras [20]. Because of the importance of 𝐴1 the natural first
andidate is 𝐺 = 𝐴2 = 𝑆𝑈 (3). Following this, we will also define an
xtension of the topological data from 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 to 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁)𝑟𝑞 . To get onto
ulti-dimensional Fibonacci-like anyonic representations and fulfill the
uantizing postulate Eq. (3), we will further restrict 𝑟 to be a multiple
f 5 larger than 𝑁 . Examples useful for gauge unification that have the
ibonacci fusion Hilbert space structure are 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 , 𝑆𝑈 (4)5𝑞 , 𝑆𝑈 (5)10𝑞 ,
𝑈 (8)10𝑞 and 𝑆𝑈 (9)10𝑞 . This allows us to address the higher dimensional
4, whose Coxeter—Dynkin diagram splits into two copies of 𝐴2, and
𝐸8, the largest exceptional Lie algebra, which has four 𝐴2 building
blocks as shown in Fig. B.3. As is well known, 𝐴4 = 𝑆𝑈 (5) and 𝐸8
are very important for unification physics. We will also discuss the
exceptional Lie algebra 𝐺2, which contains 𝑆𝑈 (3) and has a fifth-root
deformation with Fibonacci fusion rules.
3.1. Spin foam at the fifth root of unity with fermionic cycles and gauge
symmetry
Following [21,22], the deformation of the 𝑆𝑈 (3) algebra (𝑆𝑈 (𝑁) in
general) Eq. (B.6) at the fifth root of unity is given by:

hich reduces to Eq. (B.6) when 𝑞 goes to 1. From Eq. (4), [2]𝑞 = 𝜙 in
ur case.
𝑆𝑈 (3) has two Cartan generators and as in the case of 𝑆𝑈 (2) we
abel its representations by the eigenvalues of the Cartan generators.
o the representations are labeled by 2 Dynkin labels 𝑔 = (𝑝1𝑝2) in
he notation introduced above for their associated ‘‘polytopes’’, or in
more compact form by its classical dimension 1, 3, 3̄, 6, 6̄, 8 and so
n. For 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 the fusion rules are limited to the lower dimensional
epresentations 1 = (00), 3 = (10), 3̄ = (01), 6 = (20), 6̄ = (02) and
= (11). The fusion rules are given by (00)⊗(𝑝1𝑝2) = (𝑝1𝑝2) and Table 1.
To compute for general 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁)𝑞 the quantum dimensions 𝑑𝑞(𝑔),
hich will be the edge amplitudes, the spin number 𝑗 of Eq. (9), for
specific representation, is extended to a Dynkin label (𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑁−1)
describing the highest weight of the representation. For general 𝑁 ,
𝑑𝑞(𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑁−1) will be computed by the following algorithm: a Young
diagram is drawn for the Dynkin label as a set of 𝑁 left-justified rows
of 𝑝1, 𝑝2, . . . 𝑝𝑁−1 cells, from top to bottom. If 𝑝𝑁−1 > 0 there exists
a minimal 𝑀 index, 0 < 𝑀 < 𝑁 such that 𝑝𝑀+1 = 0, and we draw
only 𝑀 rows, otherwise we set 𝑀 = 𝑁 − 1. Accumulating its value
from the right to the left, we create a partition numbering the length
of successive rows in the Young diagram. The Young diagram can
be filled by numbers beginning at the top-left by an integer between
1 and 𝑁 , non increasing from left to right and strictly decreasing
from top to bottom, which enable to compute the number of elements
corresponding to different Young tableaux. This is the dimension of the
representation. It can be expressed by the Weyl dimension formula as
the ratio: the numerator is the product of the number in each box of
a tableau beginning with 𝑁 at the top-left, strictly increasing to the
left and strictly decreasing to the bottom, while the denominator is the
product of the hook number of each box, where the hook number of
any box is the number of boxes met by a hook beginning at the right of
the row, tracing horizontally to the box, then tracing vertically to the
bottom. Because the numerator will vanish if there are more than 𝑁−1
rows, the number of rows is limited. For the quantum deformation,
the same Weyl formula is applied but the integers in each box are
now quantum integers defined by Eq. (4), where [𝑟]𝑞 = 0. Therefore
the Young diagram cannot have more than 𝑟 −𝑁 columns, which sets
a cut-off for the number of representations. For 𝑁 = 3 the quantum
dimension is given by
𝑑𝑞(𝑝1, 𝑝2) = [𝑝1 + 1]𝑞[𝑝2 + 1]𝑞[𝑝1 + 𝑝2 + 2]𝑞∕[2]𝑞 . (12)
The quantum dimension 𝑑𝑞(𝑔) for 𝑔 = (00), (20), (02) is 𝑑𝑞(𝑔) = 1 and for
𝑔 = (10), (01), (11) is 𝑑𝑞(𝑔) = 𝜙. For general 𝑁 the quantum dimension
is given by [21]
𝑑𝑞(𝑝1, 𝑝2, .., 𝑝𝑁−1) =

Alternatively, we can use the general formula from which Eq. (9) is
derived, a deformation of the Weyl dimension formula to
𝑑𝑞(𝑔) =
∏
𝛼
[
(𝜔𝑔 + 𝜌, 𝛼)
]
𝑞
[(𝜌, 𝛼)]𝑞
, (14)
where 𝜔𝑔 = (𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑁−1), the highest weight describing the irreducible
representation, is given by Eq. (B.3). The vector 𝜌 is half the sum of
positive roots 𝜌 = 1
2
∑
𝛼 𝛼 and 𝛼 represent the positive roots. For 𝑆𝑈 (2)
there are only one positive root 𝛼1 = (1,−1) and the fundamental weight
is given by 𝜔1 = (1∕2,−1∕2), so 𝜌 = (1∕2,−1∕2) and 𝜔𝑔 = 𝑝1𝜔1 = 2𝑗𝜔1
and Eq. (14) reduces to Eq. (9). For 𝑁 = 3, from Eq. (B.5), the third
positive root is 𝛼3 = (1, 0,−1), 𝜌 = (1, 0,−1) and 𝜔𝑔 = 𝑝1𝜔1 + 𝑝2𝜔2. Thus
the quantum dimension reduces to Eq. (12).
We now compute the {6𝑔}5 symbols associated with a tetrahedron
edge decoration by representations of the 𝑔 = 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 algebra, which
can be generalized to 𝑔 = 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁)𝑟𝑞 . The computation of the amplitudes
{6𝑔}5 for 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁)𝑞 can always be done case by case as in [22] but we
have adapted the formulas from [23], replacing spins by a suitable
projection of the highest weight vectors in the case of multiplicity-free
quantum {6𝑔}-symbols, where we will deal with representations (10),
(01) and (00) for 𝑔 = 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 . On the decomposition of (11) ⊗ (11), we
already have to deal with multiplicities [22]. This projection operator
depends on the algebra:
(𝑤1𝑤2...𝑤𝑁−1)′ = 𝑃𝑟(𝑁, (𝑤1𝑤2...𝑤𝑁−1)) (15)
and in our multiplicity-free case is given by
(𝑤𝑔)′ =
1 ∑
(𝜔𝑔 , 𝛼), (16)4
2 𝛼
t
where again 𝜔𝑔 = (𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑁−1), the highest weight describing the
irreducible representation, and 𝛼 represent the positive roots. In the
case of 𝑆𝑈 (2) it gives the usual half integers 𝑗 and in the case of 𝑆𝑈 (3)
it gives 𝑝1 + 𝑝2. So we have
𝛥′(𝑎𝑏𝑐) = ([(−𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐)′]![(𝑎 − 𝑏 + 𝑐)′]![(𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐)′]!)1∕2

A complete algorithm to compute 𝑆𝑈 (4) Clebsch–Gordan coeffi-
ients is available in [25]; it can be extended to compute the 6j-symbols
f 𝑆𝑈 (4) for all representations. The algorithm may be extended to
igher dimensions and deformed by a procedure replacing factorials by
uantum factorials and using projected weights. The Fibonacci anyons
n 𝑔 = 𝑆𝑈 (4)5𝑞 will be restricted to only 4 representations, the fun-
amental (000), the symmetric (100), its conjugate antisymmetric (001)
nd the antisymmetric (010). Their respective quantum dimensions are
1]𝑞 , [1]𝑞 , [4]𝑞 and [4]𝑞[3]𝑞/[2]𝑞 . For 𝑟 = 5 these quantum numbers are
ll equal to 1, therefore this is adapted to decorate a graph with only
ne edge length, while 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 and 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 decorate graphs with two
dge lengths. The cut-off in the number of representations comes from
he fact that 𝑟 −𝑁 is small. The next representations, which would be
f interest for a higher 𝑟, are the symmetric (200), cut-off at 𝑟 = 5, and
he symmetric (300), cut-off at 𝑟 = 6. The Young tableau of (200) is a
row with two boxes. In the dimension formula, the numerator is the
product of the two boxes, where the leftmost has the quantum integer
[𝑁] and each one at its right increases by one, so the right one is
[𝑁 + 1] = [𝑟] = 0, which cancels this representation.
There is no representation in 𝑆𝑈 (5)5𝑞 , so we study 𝑆𝑈 (5)10𝑞 , which
is quite rich. When 𝑁 increases to meet 𝑟 − 1, the structure simpli-
fies and there are only 9 antisymmetric representations in 𝑆𝑈 (9)10𝑞 :
(08), (1 07), (01 1 06), (02 1 05)...(06 1 01) and (07 1). They will be the bricks
for the branching of 𝐸10
8𝑞 to 𝐴10
8𝑞 , which is a subject of our ongoing work.
3.2. Observables
The observables of interest, to be motivated with explicit examples
below, can be calculated from the generalization of Eq. (8) to include
fermions, which are defined as closed oriented cycles on the dual 2-
complex △∗, with 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 representations on its edges. These fixed
states can be interpreted as observables [26]. The observable of interest
is

{6𝑔}5 (25)
where 𝑜 gives a sign due to the match or mismatch of the orientations
of △∗ and the cycles {𝑐}. In this sense the cycles are fermionic — there
cannot be more than one cycle on one edge with the same orientation
relative to the orientation of △∗. The maximum is two cycles on one
edge with opposite orientation, which constrains the possible cycles.
Each edge on a cycle 𝑐 has one amplitude given by the quantum
dimension 𝑑𝑞(𝑔𝑒) of the 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 representation 𝑔 on it. The △4𝑙 is a
triangulation at level 𝑙, which we can explain with examples:
• The level 𝑙 = 0 triangulation is just one tetrahedron in △ and one
vertex inside the boundary tetrahedron.
• At the level 𝑙 = 1 triangulation we start with one tetrahedron
and connect its center with its 4 points, making four new tetra-
hedrons. Then we take the dual 2-complex in the usual way by
inserting a vertex inside each tetrahedron and connecting them.
(See Fig. A.2).
• At the level 𝑙 = 2 triangulation, our space is divided into 16
tetrahedrons. The dual 2-complex in the bulk has 16 vertices at
their centers. (See Fig. 1). And so on.
The observables 𝑂△4𝑙
(𝑔𝑐 , 𝑗𝑙𝑐 ) are functions of the 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 𝑗𝑙𝑐 repre-
sentations on the boundary faces of △∗ and 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 𝑔𝑐 on the edges
of the closed cycles. To correctly assign the {6𝑔}5 on the network, we
need to consistently choose the cycles and give consideration on how
to constraint our cycles of interest. Let us discuss this level by level.
The level 𝑙 = 0 observables:
The level 𝑙 = 0 has no bulk edges and so there are only pure
topological (gravitational) observables, Eq. (7).
The level 𝑙 = 1 observables and its {6𝑔}5:
We note that the usual observables at 𝑙 = 0 above, 𝑊 5
△1
(𝑗𝑙𝑣), are
functions of the six representations on the six boundary faces of the 2-
complex, or equivalently on the segments (edges of the tetrahedron) of
the triangulation. We can then associate a ‘‘polytope’’ of 𝑆𝑈 (2) to these
representations; they are the edges of the tetrahedron, and the building
block is the Delone polytope, the edge of 𝑝 = 1 of the (1) representation.
The only representation that does not have this interpretation is the
scalar (0), which can work as ‘‘dummy’’ indices in the 𝑊 5
△1
(𝑗𝑙𝑣). This
suggests that the observables of interest for 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 are the ones that
have a ‘‘polytope’’ interpretation in 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 so that the {6𝑔}5 would be a5
function of these ‘‘polytopes’’. In particular, these would be the Delonepolytopes, (10) or (01), and, when necessary, a ‘‘dummy’’ index with
the (00) representation to complete the {6𝑔}5 input representations.
Immediately we note that, consistently, each edge of a cycle on
△∗ is dual to a triangle of the △ and so it can have a representation
𝑔 = (10), (01) or 𝑔 = (00) sitting on it. From Fig. A.2 let us label the
representations:
• 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 on the faces of △∗, using the numbers labeling the
vertices: 𝑗1 = 𝑗12, 𝑗2 = 𝑗13, 𝑗3 = 𝑗14, 𝑗4 = 𝑗23, 𝑗5 = 𝑗24, 𝑗6 = 𝑗34,
𝑗7 = 𝑗123, 𝑗8 = 𝑗124, 𝑗9 = 𝑗134, 𝑗10 = 𝑗234.
• And for 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 on the edges from the 4 internal vertices: 𝑔1 = 𝑔12,
𝑔2 = 𝑔13, 𝑔3 = 𝑔14, 𝑔4 = 𝑔23, 𝑔5 = 𝑔24, 𝑔6 = 𝑔34.
So, for the observable 𝑂△4
(𝑔1...6, 𝑗1...6) the {6𝑔}5 is naturally associated
with the bulk tetrahedron with vertices 1,2,3,4, coupling six 𝑔 repre-
sentations on its six edges. So the set of allowed cycles {𝑐} are the
ones covering this tetrahedron, and this can be done with 4 triangular
cycles. Note that any configuration with all (01) or (10), e.g. 𝑔1...6 =
((10), (01), (10), (10), (10), (01)), gives {6𝑔}5 = 0. But by inserting the rep-
resentation (00) we can have non-zero {6𝑔}5 and the observables can
be computed, as for example for 𝑔1...6 = ((01), (10), (01), (01), (00), (00)),
which gives, from Eq. (23), {6𝑔}5 = 𝜙−1. In this case, for the amplitude
{6𝑔}5 we are using the fundamental (10) and anti-fundamental (01)
representations which compose the Voronoi polytope of 𝑆𝑈 (3).
One example of an interesting observable, which can be interpreted
as a coupling interaction of the 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 and 𝑆𝑈 (3)5𝑞 representations,
is defined in the following way. First we choose an orientation on
△∗ to be given by one incoming edge from the boundary to vertex
4, then to vertices 1, 2 and 3. From 3, the oriented edges go to 1,
2 and from 1, 2 they go out (see Fig. A.2). The cycle 𝑐1 is 123, 𝑐2
is 142, 𝑐3 is 134 and 𝑐4 is 243. There is only one other option of
cycles, which is the one with the inversion of orientation of all 4
cycles. For 𝑔1...6 = ((10), (01), (01), (01), (00), (10)) fixed, from Eq. (24),
{6𝑔}5 = −𝜙−1, imposing consistency of both representations on △
(where, for example, a 𝑔1 = (01) fixes 𝑗1 = 1∕2 (𝑝 = 1, 𝑗 = 2𝑝)) leads to
𝑗1...10 = ( 12 ,
1
2 ,
1
2 , 0, 0, 0, 0,
1
2 , 0,
1
2 ). Thus, working with the unnormalized
amplitudes, we have
𝑂△4
(𝑔1...6, 𝑗1...10) = (−1)𝑗1 ...(−1)𝑗10𝑑𝑞(𝑗1)...𝑑𝑞(𝑗10)𝑊 5

ote that in this example all internal 𝑗’s are fixed by fixing the 𝑔’s, and
o we could first have fixed all the 10 𝑗’s, which gives a topological
nvariant observable of 𝑆𝑈 (2)5𝑞 [26], and the 𝑔’s can be interpreted as
mergent properties of the network.
he level 𝑙 = 2 observables and its {6𝑔}5:
Now we have 4 tetrahedrons similar to the ones on 𝑙 = 1. They
re connected to form 4 hexagonal cycles (see Fig. 1, where internal
ertices are labeled with positive integers and external points with
egative integers): 𝑐1 = {7, 14, 15, 11, 10, 6}, 𝑐2 = {6, 10, 12, 19,
8, 8}, 𝑐3 = {8, 18, 20, 16, 14, 7}, 𝑐4 = {11, 15, 16, 20, 19, 12}, where
𝑛 is a hexagonal face (an irregular hexagon alternating short and long
inks), viewed from an outside point −𝑛. Along each of these cycles,
he 3 long edges are shared with short cycles completed by a vertex
aking a dual tetrahedron. For 𝑐1: 𝑐1.2 = {15, 14, 16 or 13}, 𝑐1.3 = {10,
1, 12 or 9}, 𝑐1.4 = {7, 6, 8 or 5}. The link 𝑐1.2 is shared between 𝑐1,
3 and 𝑐4, therefore 𝑐1.2 = 𝑐3.2 = 𝑐4.2. The link 𝑐1.3 is shared between 𝑐1,
2 and 𝑐4, so 𝑐1.3 = 𝑐2.3 = 𝑐4.3. The link 𝑐1.4 is shared between 𝑐1, 𝑐2 and
3, so 𝑐1.4 = 𝑐2.4 = 𝑐3.4. The last short cycles are 𝑐2.1 = 𝑐3.1 = 𝑐4.1 = {18,
9, 20 or 17}. All four short cycles extended as tetrahedrons cover all
he 16 level 𝑙 = 2 vertices (centers dual to the 𝑙 = 2 tetrahedrons), here
ndexed from 5 to 20.

3.3. Unification physics from the exceptional Lie algebras
Let us consider the lowest dimensional exceptional Lie algebra, 𝐺2,
at the fifth root of unity - 𝐺5
2𝑞
. 𝐺2, like 𝑆𝑈 (3), is of rank 2, and is
the only exceptional one for which a fifth-root quantum deformation is
possible. The generalization of Eq. (11) to the exceptional Lie algebras
has only 2 equations changed, namely [21,22],

only 2 representations in the fusion rules, the 1 dimensional 1 = (00)
and the 7 dimensional, 7 = (01)3. The only non trivial fusion rule is
(01)⊗ (01) = (00)⊕ (01), (28)
which is the well known Fibonacci (anyon) fusion rule. The quantum
dimensions, which are the amplitudes on the edges of the △*, are
𝑑(00)𝑞 = 1 and 𝑑(01)𝑞 = 𝜙. For the {6𝑔}5 amplitudes for 𝐺5
2𝑞
there are 64
possibles ones but only 15 are not null, which constrains the available
observables. They are given in [22]. It is therefore easy to compute
observables for 𝐺5
2𝑞
using Eq. (25) and following the procedure of
previous sections. In the first levels of the triangulation, however, we
find no polytope interpretation, which would be a hexagon with a point
in the center, on the triangulation. This leads us to suggest that the
exceptional Lie algebras work as a container for the lower dimensional
3 Note that we are using the same notation used for 𝑆𝑈 (3) in previous
sections, but the convex polytope possessing the symmetry of the Coxeter–
Weyl group, as the orbit of its highest weight vector, by acting with 𝑊 (𝐺2), is
a different polytope, a hexagon made of the two triangles of 𝑆𝑈 (3), (10) and
(01), and a point in the center, the (00) representation.6
Lie algebras, 𝑆𝑈 (2) and 𝑆𝑈 (3), which are in fact the gauge symmetries.
Note that the fusion rule of {6𝑔}5 contains only the representations that
appear in the observable Eq. (26), because the 7 of 𝐺2 contains the (10),
(01) and (00) of 𝑆𝑈 (3). This gives a role to 𝐺2 as the one that unifies
those lower dimensional gauge symmetries.
With 𝐺5
2𝑞
having only one non-trivial fusion rule, the generalization
to higher dimensional Lie algebras may best be done with the tenth
root of unity. Another option is that our observables already capture
information of higher dimension through projection. This can be seen
from the Coxeter—Dynkin diagram of 𝑆𝑈 (5) and 𝐸8. See for example
the magic star projection of 𝐸8 to 2D [27].
4. Conclusions
In this paper we have presented quantum gravity observables cou-
pling internal gauge symmetry with spacetime symmetry in a spin foam
model. We note that in usual spin foam or state sum models in 3D, there
are 2D states, whose evolution is described by 3D transition amplitudes.
In this paper we presented a Wilson lattice gauge theory perspective
where fermionic observables are cycles that go through the 3D foam.
This fixes a notion of 3D states for the 3D theory. Thus the whole
discussion of transition amplitudes in 3D, which one might ordinarily
think of as being about dynamics, is in fact more about the kinematics
of quantum gravity. Note that the kinematical space of 3D spin foam
theory is the same as for 4D, i.e., the 3D spin network states are the
same as in 4D — they are 𝑆𝑈 (2) spin networks. The difference is that in
3D they are made of trivalent graphs and in 4D with graphs with higher
valence. Our discussion in the 3D model suggests that the topological
observables can have similar role in 4D. The evolution of these 3D
observables is expected to give the true dynamics in the full 4D theory.
This can give an alternative route to explicit computations of the full
spin foam amplitudes, which are a subject of recent interest [28,29].
It is also well known that the {6𝑗}𝑞 symbols for 𝑆𝑈 (2)𝑞 give the
exponential of the Einstein–Hilbert action in the limit of large spin
quantum numbers, indicating a good semi-classical limit. In our case
it will be interesting to investigate the limit with large cycles through
the spin foam as well as the semi classical limit of the symbols from
𝑆𝑈 (3)𝑞 and 𝑆𝑈 (𝑁)𝑞 in general.
We also presented a Lie algebra polytope interpretation of the
transition amplitudes and observables, a ‘‘gravitahedra’’ [30] for spin
foam quantum gravity. The representation theory polytopes emerge
from the spin foam. This work opens up new questions for subsequent
research such as questions on (1) phase transition and confinement
within the anyonic code, (2) direct connection with particle physics
observables and the notion of extended particle observables, (3) the
complete formulation with larger Lie algebra amplitudes. The fifth root
of unity also has limits on the large dimensional algebras which can be
addressed — it stops at 𝑆𝑈 (5) = 𝐴4 in the 𝐴𝑛 series, for example. It will
be interesting to investigate the tenth root of unity to incorporate larger
Lie algebras as it also has a Fibonacci fusion Hilbert space structure.
The transition amplitudes, partition functions and observables dis-
cussed in this paper are all finite, which is supported by the tetrahedron
quantization postulate to impose the fifth root of unity quantization.
This quantization allows us to explicitly compute the amplitudes with
some examples as well as to interpretate the pre-spacetime frame-
work as a topological quantum computer. The universality of the sim-
plest non-abelian (Fibonacci) anyon for quantum computation and its
usefulness for explicitly computations of quantum gravity amplitudes
motivates it as a start point postulate.

Appendix A. Review of spin foam models and its q-deformation
regularization
Following [1], mainly chapters 5 and 6, we consider a discretization
of spacetime in terms of a triangulation (△) and its dual 2-complex
(△*). A three-dimensional triangulation is given by tetrahedrons, tri-
angles, segments and points. For a four-dimensional triangulation, we
include the 4-simplex. The dual 2-complex in three-dimensional (3D)
bulk is made by associating a tetrahedron with a vertex, a triangle
with an edge, and a segment with a face. On the boundary, the dual of
triangles are nodes and segments are links. In four dimensions (4D), the
dual of a 4-simplex is a vertex, the dual of a tetrahedron is an edge and
the dual of a triangle is a face. The boundary graph and terminology are
equal to 3D. The gauge group of symmetry is 𝑆𝑈 (2) in 3D, the covering
group of the rotation group 𝑆𝑂(3), and 𝑆𝐿(2, 𝐶) or 𝑆𝑈 (2) × 𝑆𝑈 (2)
in 4d, the respective covering groups of the Lorentz group and the
4D rotation group 𝑆𝑂(4). The variables are 𝑆𝑈 (2) group elements 𝑈𝑒
associated to edges 𝑒 in the bulk of △* or 𝑈𝑙 associated to links 𝑙 on
he boundary, and algebra elements 𝐿𝑓 = 𝐿𝑖
𝑓𝐽𝑖 associated to faces 𝑓
f △* or 𝐿𝑙 = 𝐿𝑖
𝑙𝐽𝑖 associated to links on the boundary. 𝐽𝑖 are the
𝑈 (2) generators, 𝐽𝑖 =
𝑖
2𝜎𝑖, where 𝜎𝑖 are the usual Pauli matrices. The
uantization involves operators 𝑈𝑙 and 𝐿𝑙 on the boundary realizing a
commutation relation on a Hilbert space,

𝑈𝑙 , 𝐿

where 𝛽 is a constant related to the gravitational constant, 𝛿𝑙𝑙′ is the

tates are wavefunctions 𝛹 (𝑈𝑙) or 𝛹 (𝐿𝑙) of 𝐿 group/algebra elements
on 𝐿 links of the boundary graph modulo the 𝑆𝑈 (2) gauge symmetry
implemented on the nodes. The Hilbert space is the space of square
integrable functions of these coordinates:
𝛤 = 𝐿2
[
𝑆𝑈 (2)𝐿∕𝑆𝑈 (2)𝑁
]
𝛤 (A.3)
where 𝛤 is the boundary graph. The gauge invariant states must satisfy
𝛹 (𝑈𝑙) = 𝛹
(
𝜆𝑠𝑙𝑈𝑙𝜆−1𝑡𝑙
)
for every node 𝑛 of the boundary graph. One
major realization of loop quantum gravity is that the kinematics are
the same in 3D and 4D — the Hilbert space and commutation relations
are in both cases the ones for the 𝑆𝑈 (2) group. The distinction from
3D to 4D arises only in the dynamics, with the 4D gauge symmetry
𝑆𝐿(2, 𝐶) or 𝑆𝑈 (2) × 𝑆𝑈 (2) implemented on the bulk of the spin foam.
The dynamics are implemented in the form of a state sum model
with quantum transition amplitudes or partition functions. Let us con-
sider first the transition amplitude. It is a function of the states defined
on 𝛤 = (𝜕△)∗, the boundary graph. This can be defined in the group
representation 𝑊△(𝑈𝑙) or in the so called spin representation 𝑊△(𝑗𝑓 ),
where the △ indicates that the amplitude is computed in a discretiza-
tion △ of the bulk that matches the boundary graph. In 𝑊△(𝑗𝑓 ), a
basis on the gauge invariant Hilbert space is given by the normalized
eigenvectors of the operator 𝐿𝑙, indicated by |𝑗𝑓 ⟩. An element of this
basis is determined by assigning a spin 𝑗𝑙 of a representation of 𝑆𝑈 (2)
to each link 𝑙 of the graph. A graph with a spin assigned to each link
is called a spin network. So the spin network states |𝑗𝑓 ⟩ form a basis
of the gauge invariant Hilbert space of quantum gravity, i.e. they span
the quantum states of the geometry. The quantum transition amplitude
is given by
𝑊△(𝑗𝑙) = △
∑
𝑗𝑓
∏
𝑓
𝐴𝑗𝑓
∏
𝑣
𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ), (A.4)
where △ is a normalization constant that can depend on the dis-
cretization, and there is an amplitude 𝐴𝑗𝑓 for each face of △* and
an amplitude 𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ) for each vertex, both in 3D and 4D. Equivalently,7
in 3D, the amplitude 𝐴𝑗𝑓 can be defined on the segments of △ and𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ) on the tetrahedrons4. Similarly, in 4D the amplitude 𝐴𝑗𝑓 can
be defined on the triangles of △ and 𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ) on the 4-simplexes5. The
partition function (𝑍△) in the situation with the triangulation without
boundaries is the same as Eq. (A.4) but summing also over the boundary
representations.
From now on we will consider the 3-dimensional spin foam model,
but it was necessary to point out in the preceding review that the step
from 3D to 4D is not a big one. In the spin network basis we have that
the amplitudes 𝐴𝑗𝑓 are given by the dimension of the representation,
𝑑𝑗 , and the vertex amplitude 𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ), which implements the 𝑆𝑈 (2)
symmetry, is a function that takes the 6 spin quantum numbers of the
representations on the 6 edges of the tetrahedron around a vertex and
returns a complex number. The vertex amplitude in this case is given
mainly by the Wigner 6j-symbol {6𝑗} =
{
𝑗1 𝑗2 𝑗3

}

transition amplitude is

where 𝑗𝑣 =

𝑎=1 𝑗𝑎.
Note that even with the definition of this object on a truncation
of the triangulation, still there are non-physical divergences. We see
this by first writing explicitly Eq. (A.5) for a triangulation made of
1 tetrahedron. The dual is made of a vertex inside the tetrahedron
connected to a node on each of the 4 triangular faces. The dual
has 6 boundary faces that we label with 6 𝑆𝑈 (2) representations (or
equivalently there is a dual tetrahedron and the representations are
living on its edges) and the transition amplitude is immediately

(𝑗𝑙) = (−1)𝑗𝑣

(A.6)
and is well defined, although for the partition function one should sum
over the infinite number of 𝑆𝑈 (2), 𝑗𝑓 , representations. The problem
for transition amplitudes already occurs for the triangulation with only
four tetrahedrons, made by inserting a point inside the initial large
one and connecting it with the 4 tetrahedron points. The dual is made
of four vertices inside the 4 tetrahedrons connected with each other
and the boundary faces. Now there are the 6 boundary faces with
representations labeled 𝑗1...𝑗6, plus 4 internal faces, 𝑗7...𝑗10, of the dual,
(see Fig. A.2). What happens is that even with the 6 boundary spin
representations fixed, the classical 𝑆𝑈 (2) fusion rules do not give a
constraint on the spin representations on these internal faces, and the
amplitude can diverge

nal ones. These internal spins are not fixed by triangular inequalities.
All the four internal spins form an internal tetrahedron where the spins
can flow without restriction — the tetrahedron with the vertices 1, 2,
3 and 4 in Fig. A.2. From results of LQG, the spin quantum numbers
correspond to eigenvalues of geometrical operators such as lengths and
areas, and so there is a divergence when the scale of the geometry
becomes large, a kind of infrared divergence. This is possible because in
Riemannian geometry the space can be strongly curved. The 4 internal
faces form what is called a bubble in LQG, and the divergence for a
large spin sitting on an internal triangular face is called a spike.
4 The input for 𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ) are the representations on each one of the 6 faces
djacent to the vertex or the representations on the 6 segments that form the
etrahedron. We can note that 𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ) comes from a path integral quantization
nd gives the weighted value of the field at one point of the discretization.
5 The 4-simplex has 10 edges and 10 triangles, so the input for 𝐴𝑣(𝑗𝑓 ) are
0 representations. The boundary graph of the amplitude is a pentagram.

the representation theory of quantum groups [31] we know that the
spin quantum numbers of 𝑆𝑈 (2)𝑞 are constrained to 𝑗 ≤ 𝑟−2

as a cut off for the flow of spin on the bubbles. The usual trian-
gular inequalities are modified and supplemented by the conditions
2𝑗1, 2𝑗2, 2𝑗3 ≤ 𝑗1+ 𝑗2+ 𝑗3 ≤ 𝑟−2, which are the triangular inequalities of
a triangle on a sphere with a radius determined by 𝑟. The geometry of
𝑞-deformed spin networks is therefore consistent with the geometry of
constant curvature space, with the curvature determined by the specific
root of unity.
Our particular synthesis of this result is that a general large spin
transition amplitude should be built from ‘‘gluing’’ quantum building

Appendix B. Gauge grand unification physics review
Let us provide a short review of the Lie algebra unification physics
program closely following the Refs. [4–6]. The well known representa-
tion theory of 𝑆𝑈 (2) can be extended to higher dimensional Lie groups
and algebras. The structure of a simple Lie algebra is described by its
root and weight systems. The classification of simple Lie algebras is an
extensive subject on which we recommend the Refs. [4,7,8]. Here we
collect and review just the elements necessary for our discussion. For

example we have that the root system 𝐴𝑛 describes 𝑆𝑈 (𝑛 + 1), while
𝐷𝑛, with 𝑛 ≥ 3, describes the Lie algebra of 𝑆𝑂(2𝑛). The exceptional Lie
algebras 𝐺2, 𝐹4, 𝐸6, 𝐸7 and 𝐸8 have their root systems with the same
respective names. For our discussion we will focus on 𝐴𝑛, in particular
𝐴2, and 𝐸8, whose importance for coupling the charge space with spin
foam was pointed out in [32], and which contains the other exceptional
Lie algebras as well the 𝐴𝑛 for lower 𝑛.
Let us consider a Euclidean space 𝑉 of dimension 𝑛. One can
introduce an orthonormal basis, 𝑙𝑖 (𝑖 = 1, 2,… , 𝑛), in 𝑉 so that the
Euclidean scalar product (𝑢, 𝑣) of 𝑢 =
∑
𝑖 𝜆𝑖𝑙𝑖 and 𝑣 =
∑
𝑖 𝜇𝑖𝑙𝑖 is (𝑢, 𝑣) =
∑
𝑖 𝜆𝑖𝜇𝑖. The Coxeter—Dynkin diagrams of 𝐴𝑛, 𝐷𝑛 and 𝐸8 are shown
in Fig. B.3. The nodes on the Coxeter—Dynkin diagram represent the
simple roots 𝛼𝑖, (𝑖 = 1, 2,… , 𝑛), of the associated Lie algebra of rank
𝑛8 and two dots linked by an edge correspond to two roots whose
scalar product is −1. The other pairs of nodes, which are not connected,
correspond to vectors that are orthogonal. The Cartan matrix elements
are
𝐶𝑖𝑗 =
2(𝛼𝑖, 𝛼𝑗 )
(𝛼𝑗 , 𝛼𝑗 )
. (B.1)
Complementary to the simple roots, there are the fundamental weight
vectors 𝜔𝑖, which are defined by the relation with the simple roots
(𝜔𝑖, 𝛼𝑗 ) = 𝛿𝑖𝑗 and are related to each other by (𝜔𝑖, 𝜔𝑗 ) = (𝐶−1)𝑖𝑗 . The
root lattice 𝛬 is the set of vectors 𝑝 =
∑𝑛
𝑖 𝑏𝑖𝛼𝑖, 𝑏𝑖 ∈ Z. Similarly the
weight lattice 𝛬∗ is the set of vectors 𝑞 =
∑𝑛
𝑖 𝑝𝑖𝜔𝑖, 𝑝𝑖 ∈ Z. The reflection
generator with respect to the hyperplane orthogonal to the simple root
𝛼𝑖 is 𝑟𝑖, (𝑖 = 1,… , 𝑛), which operates on an arbitrary vector 𝜆 as
𝑟𝑖𝜆 = 𝜆 −
2(𝜆, 𝛼𝑖)
(𝛼𝑖, 𝛼𝑖)
𝛼𝑖. (B.2)
It transforms a fundamental weight vector as 𝑟𝑖𝜔𝑗 = 𝜔𝑗 − 𝛼𝑖𝛿𝑖𝑗 . These
generators form the Coxeter reflection group (Weyl group) acting on the
root system 𝐺 defined by the presentation 𝑊 (𝐺) = ⟨𝑟1,… , 𝑟𝑛|(𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑗 )
𝑚𝑖𝑗 =
1⟩. When they act on one of the simple roots of a simple Lie algebra
they generate the root system 𝑊 (𝐺)𝛼𝑖.
The concept of polytopes is important to our discussion. The root
polytope is a convex polytope whose vertices are vectors of the root
system. The highest weight vector for an irreducible representation of
the Lie algebra is defined as the weight vector 𝜔𝑟𝑒𝑝 = (𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑛), where
𝑝𝑖 are positive integers called Dynkin labels. The highest weight of any
irreducible representation decomposes on fundamental weights, and its
components are its Dynkin labels
𝜔𝑟𝑒𝑝 =
∑
𝑖
𝑝𝑖𝜔𝑖. (B.3)
The highest weight vector has an associated polytope, which is the con-
vex polytope possessing the symmetry of the Coxeter–Weyl group as the
orbit of this highest weight vector 𝑊 (𝐺)(𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑛) = (𝑝1,… , 𝑝𝑛)𝑔 . With
this notation the root polytope of 𝑊 (𝐴𝑛) is given, in a simplified form,
as (10...01)𝐴𝑛
. For 𝐴2, for example, (11) describes the root polytope,
the hexagon with 2 points in the middle in Fig. B.4, and each point

corresponds to one of the 8 states of the adjoint representation, so (11)
can refer also to the whole adjoint representation. The fundamental
simplex of the lattice 𝐴𝑛 is a convex polytope with 𝑛 + 1 vertices
given by 𝜔1,… , 𝜔𝑛 and the origin (0). The Voronoi polytope 𝑉 (0)
centered at the origin of the lattice 𝛬 is the set of points 𝑉 (0) =
{
𝑥 ∈ R𝑛,∀𝑝, (𝑥, 𝑝) ≤ 1
2 (𝑝, 𝑝)
}
. Let 𝑣 ∈ R𝑛 be a vertex of an arbitrary
Voronoi polytope 𝑉 (𝑝). The convex hull of the lattice points closest to
𝑣 is called the Delone polytope containing 𝑣. Vertices of the Voronoi
cell 𝑉 (0) of the root lattices of the 𝐴𝑛 series consist of the vertices of
the Delone cells centered at the origin.
Let us show the analogue of these polytopes in lower dimension for
𝐴1 = 𝑆𝑈 (2). First we will write the eigenvalues in integer form, 𝑝 = 2𝑗
and then:
• 𝑝 = 1 is the highest weight of the fundamental representation with
one reflection that sends it to the state 𝑝 = −1. The edge from the
𝑝 = −1 to 𝑝 = 1 is the Voronoi polytope, written (1) in the notation
above.
• With 𝑝 = 2, operating with the 𝑊 (𝐴1) one gets the other 2 states
of the adjoint representation, 𝑝 = 0 and 𝑝 = −2. The edge from
𝑝 = −2 to 𝑝 = 2 forms the root polytope which is the dual of the
Voronoi polytope, and is represented as (2), which also indicates
the adjoint representation.
• Note that the building block is the Delone polytope which is an
edge of length 1.
For 𝐴2 we present the representations of interest in Fig. B.4, and
note that the Voronoi cell is the hexagon made of the 2 triangles (10)
and (01), while the Delone cell’s building blocks are the triangles whose
centers are the vertices of the Voronoi cell. Each one is equivalent to
one of the triangles (10) and (01) - and six of them make the hexagon
root polytope.
It is not necessary to introduce the polytopes of the exceptional Lie
algebras because we will work with 𝐺2 and 𝐸8 only as a container
for the interaction between its 𝐴2 subalgebras, which will be our main
objects.
To present a general representation of the roots and the weights
of 𝐴𝑛 we add one vector to our orthonormal set of vectors, 𝑙𝑖 (𝑖 =
1, 2,… , 𝑛 + 1), (𝑙𝑖, 𝑙𝑗 ) = 𝛿𝑖𝑗 . We define the simple roots as linear
combinations of orthonormal vectors 𝛼𝑖 = 𝑙𝑖 − 𝑙𝑖+1, (𝑖 = 1, 2,… , 𝑛).
The group generators 𝑟𝑖 permute the set of orthonormal vectors as
𝑟𝑖 ∶ 𝑙𝑖 ↔ 𝑙𝑖+1. When we define the vectors in terms of their components
in the 𝑛 + 1 dimensional Euclidean space the simple roots and the
fundamental weights read
𝛼1 = (1,−1, 0,… , 0); ...; 𝛼𝑛 = (0, 0,… , 1,−1);
𝜔1 = 1
𝑛 + 1
(𝑛,−1,… ,−1);𝜔2 =

𝑛 + 1
(𝑛 − 1, 𝑛 − 1,−2,… ,−2);
...; 𝜔𝑛 =
1
𝑛 + 1
(1, 1,… , 1,−𝑛). (B.4)
For 𝑆𝑈 (3) we have the simple roots and weights
𝛼 = (1,−1, 0),9
1
𝛼2 = (0, 1,−1),
𝜔1 = (2∕3,−1∕3,−1∕3),
𝜔2 = (1∕3, 1∕3,−2∕3). (B.5)
They can be used to compute the scalar products on the amplitudes
discussed below.
The derivation of the Lie algebra from its root system is standard.
Let us consider the generalization of Eq. (2) for 𝑆𝑈 (2) to 𝑆𝑈 (3). To
each of the 2 simple roots 𝛼𝑖 we associate three generators ℎ𝑖, 𝐿+
𝑖 and
𝐿−
𝑖 . These generate the 𝑆𝑈 (3) algebra subject to the relations

where, from Eq. (B.1), 𝐶𝑖𝑗 = −1+3𝛿𝑖𝑗 . The Cartan–Weyl basis, or in this
situation the Chevalley basis, allows us to write the large dimensional
Lie algebra in terms of the relationship between its building block
𝑆𝑈 (2) subalgebras.
