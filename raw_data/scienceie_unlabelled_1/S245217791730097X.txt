Additional possibilities for complex analysis of two-dimensional coatings (thickness< 1 nm or< 10 ML) grown
by physical vapor deposition (PVD) on a single-crystal silicon substrate under two deposition regimes have been
revealed: 1) low-temperature (at a low beam temperature) and 2) high-temperature (at an elevated temperature
of the beam), respectively. Coatings, including those in the form of pure metal and a silicide mixture, and their
interface with the substrate have been analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and characteristic electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). A technology of the deposition from a ribboned source has been developed to
ensure both deposition regimes. The conventional uses of AES are limited to the characterization of elemental
composition, electron energy structure and coating thickness. For EELS, the conventional uses are the de-
termination of phase types (valence electron density) and phase formation stages. The simultaneous use of the
two methods and the choice of equal (and minimal) probing depths, ~ 2.5 nm (primary electron energy 300 eV),
provided new possibilities for studying subnanometric two-dimensional coatings, in particular, for comparison
of coating composition and density. The chosen probing depth also made it possible to characterize the interface
between the coating and the substrate. At the same time, the use of similar probing depths made allowed using
the thickness of the coating obtained from AES data for analyzing EELS data. In addition, other possibilities have
been considered, i.e., the use of the following dependences: a) the energy of the plasmon satellite of the Auger
peak vs the thickness of the coating for analyzing changes in the electron density in the near-interface layer of
silicon; b) the attenuation of the Auger signal generated by marker atoms at the interface between the coating
and the substrate for localizing the adsorption sites of the deposited atoms; c) the intensity and energy of the loss
peaks in the EELS as a function of the primary electron energy for depth profiling of coating compositions. The
use of two depth attenuation functions for two probing depths has enabled a quantitative Auger analysis of
binary coatings. These advantages have provided the possibility of a more complete characterization of two-
dimensional coatings and their interfaces with substrates, as well as the coating formation processes. In parti-
cular, it has for the first time become possible to identify the wetting nanophase layer of metals on silicon
substrates, to investigate the process of its formation and to show how its composition depends on vapor-phase
physical deposition modes.
The development of new two-dimensional materials which may find
application in electronics [1], e.g. monoatomic [2] and thicker (mul-
tiatomic [3] or wetting [4]) metallic coatings on silicon substrates,
enabled new phase structure and chemical state characterization
methods. Of special interest among these methods are Auger electron
spectroscopy (AES) and characteristic electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS). These two methods allow characterization of coatings in va-
cuum during physical vapor deposition (PVD).
Indeed, AES and EELS find broad application for the in situ char-
acterization of element ratios in coatings [5], as well as their chemical
[6] and phase [7] states.
The conventional use of AES is the composition analysis of bulk
specimens [8–10], including destructive ion beam etching composition
depth profiling methods [11]. In the latter case the Auger primary
electron energy is high (2500+ eV). This provides for better beam fo-
cusing which is of special importance for scanning Auger spectroscopy
and minimizing the effect of the surface on the results of analysis for the
specimen bulk. Quantitative Auger characterization provided tabulated

data for elemental sensitivity coefficients of various bulk materials
[12].
Regarding the conventional use of EELS, this is primarily the energy
selective imaging in electron microscopy [13]. The method is used for
the phase (valence electron losses) or elemental (deep level ionization
losses) mapping of bulk specimen composition by electron energy fil-
tering in the characteristic loss region. Another important application of
the method is the quantitative elemental composition characterization
by deep level ionization [13]. Since recently valence electron EELS has
been used in electron microscopy for indirect phase hardness mapping
[14]. Also known is EELS use for composition characterization of binary
systems by elastic peak intensity [4,15] or from the integral valence
electron energy loss spectrum [16].
Before the 1990s the AES and EELS methods were used for the phase
structure analysis of surface and the surface phases [17]. However, that
use only replicated their conventional applications. Later the interest to
the methods expired due to the development of simple methods of
scanning probe microscopy / spectroscopy which are more information
valuable and sensitive to surfaces and monolayers [18].
Many works and overviews published before the mid-1990s dealt
with EELS and especially AES analysis. However, there have been no-
ticeably fewer AES overviews [19,20], the same being in the EELS lit-
erature, except for high resolution EELS in vibration peak analysis at
energies of up to hundreds meV. There are only an overview of EELS in
electron microscopy [21] and an EELS map of surface phases [22], but
neither of these works dealt with two-dimensional coating analysis with
these methods.
However, AES and EELS are indispensable in specific areas. One of
them is subnanometer coating thickness analysis (two-dimensional
coatings). The other application relates to coatings which may be not
single crystalline and coatings that form under nonequilibrium growth
conditions. Examples are PVD metallic coatings on silicon synthesized
at room or lower temperatures which are typically not epitaxial.
However, the tabulated elemental sensitivity coefficients for bulk
specimens cannot be used for subnanometer thick coating character-
ization. This latter application requires allowance for substrate con-
tribution and atomic density which differ from those for the bulk. This
allowance can only be made on the basis of experimental data obtained
for other additional parameters or with an alternative analytical
method. The simultaneous use of AES and EELS simplifies the task.
Furthermore, complex analysis with the two methods for the same
probing depth of the structural, chemical and phase state of two-di-
mensional coatings and their interfaces with substrates provides addi-
tional possibilities [4,23], e.g.
– the dependence of the EELS peak energy and intensity on the pri-
mary beam energy provides information on the total thickness of the
coating and, moreover, on the thickness of its layers and even on the
interlayer spacing;
– the energy positions of the plasmon Auger peak satellites of the
substrate atoms allows assessing the electron density in the coating
directly at the substrate interface;
– quantitative Auger characterization with a simulated depth extinc-
tion function and characterization of two-dimensional coatings with
nonuniform thickness;
– the dependence of the Auger peak intensity of the marker atoms on
the substrate surface on the coating thickness can be used for lo-
calizing the positions of the adsorbed deposited atoms relative to the
marker atoms.
In addition, AES provides understanding of coating growth me-
chanisms, i.e. layerwise, island, layerwise/island and more complex
ones (e.g. mixing and/or segregation growth). EELS further allows
tracking changes in the atomic density of coatings if they occur at un-
changed element composition. Furthermore, one can detect changes in
the state of the coating/substrate interface during the growth if AES and
EELS are used simultaneously. This requires maintaining the same
probing depth for the methods which should cover the growing film and
reach the interface. Then, knowing the extinction function from the AES
data and detracting the substrate contribution from the EELS spectra
one can evaluate the electron density in the coating. And, vice versa,
subtracting the coating contribution one can calculate the electron
density in the substrate in the vicinity of the interface. One can also
determine the coating growth mechanism and thickness based on solely
the AES data for the same probing depth, by choosing between possible
mechanisms. This requires applying the Auger analysis iteration, first
for small coatings within the simplest growth model (typically, layer-
wise) and then for other coatings by verifying the growth mechanism at
each iteration stage.
The first two-dimensional coatings were grown and studied on si-
licon [17] as this material is the most widely used substrate in the
microelectronics technology. We also grew and characterized these
coatings with AES and EELS. The targets of the study were the interface
formation processes and the transient 3d metal (Cr, Co, Fe, Cu) / silicon
system.
This system exhibits strong interaction between the metal and the
substrate, this being the cause of two-dimensional coating formation at
greater than monolayer thicknesses. As has become clear by now, these
coatings have a nanophase structure and exhibit wetting thermo-
dynamic properties [4]. We obtained wetting layers of silicides and
metals on silicon. This was achieved by reducing the heat power of the
vapor source and modifying the source design by sputtering the eva-
porated material on a tantalum ribbon [24]. As a result we could study
two VPD modes [4]:
– high-temperature (conventional) growth causing interdiffusion be-
tween the metal and the silicon substrate;
– low-temperature (lowered beam temperature) growth providing for
an almost pure metal coating.
There are no literary data on this simultaneous used of AES and
EELS, and we therefore will mainly dwell upon the unique experimental
results.
This work is a compilation of experimental results on the variety of
AES and EELS capabilities in the study of the structural phase and
chemical state of two-dimensional coatings and their interfaces during
the growth. Our emphasis was on the early growth stages in the tran-
sient 3d metal (Cr, Co, Fe, Cu) / silicon system.
AES composition and growth mechanism analysis of two-
dimensional coatings
Quantitative Auger characterization of binary coatings
Auger analysis of nonuniform thickness nanostructures consisting of
a binary two-dimensional coating AxB(1-x) and a substrate AyB(1-y) is of
special importance for the study of the early growth stages of these
nanostructures. Examples are two-dimensional silicide phases on silicon
forming at an early silicide growth stage [4].
The thickness of the two-dimensional phases is typically smaller
than the Auger electron depth and far smaller compared with the
backscattered electron range. Therefore the two-dimensional phase
contribution to the backscattering factor can be ignored for simplifying
Auger analysis. For a quantitative characterization of a two-dimen-
sional coating / substrate AxB(1-x)/ AyB(1-y) structure in a binary inter-
metallic system AB one should determine three parameters: coating
thickness, coating composition and substrate composition. As a rule,
only one of these parameters is known, so the task is to find the other
two. This can be done by measuring the peak intensities in the AES
spectra (IA and IB) for two probing depths (Ds and Dv, where Ds ≪ Dv).
These probing depths are controlled by the AES peak energy (Es and Ev)
and the primary electron energy (E0). If the coating thickness d and the

refer to Auger electrons with low (30–150 eV) and high (500–2000 eV)
energies, respectively, at which the probing depth with allowance for
the free path length [10] and the shape of the cylindrical Auger re-
flection analyzer (the entrance angle is 0 arc deg and the exit angle is 45
arc deg) is in the ranges 0.25 nm for Ds and 0.5–9 nm for Dv, respec-
tively.
Example of quantitative Auger characterization of Cr on Si and Si on
CrSi2 coatings was provided earlier in a tabulated form [23]. The matrix
factor β was experimentally obtained for a homogeneous reference
AzB(1-z) specimen of the CrSi2 composition.
These data along with the EELS peak depth profiling [23] can be
used for the structural modeling of the two-dimensional phases. One
should, however, bear in mind that Eqs. (1)–(3) are only true in the
abovementioned assumptions.

Auger analysis by substrate marker atom signal extinction
Surface atoms S in a submicron thickness two-dimensional coating
may have the following positions relative to the marker atoms M on the
substrate surface:
– type A: S over M;
– type B: S between M;
– type C: S over and between M.
Obviously, the signal extinction of the substrate atoms M will differ
depending on their positions: strong for the type A, weaker for the type
B and moderate for the type C. The degree of Auger peak extinction for
the marker atoms M can be determined from the atom arrangement
type (adsorption type) in the surface coating S, i.e., A, B or C. moreover,
one can observe a change in the adsorption type, e.g. A to C transition.
The pattern of Auger peak extinction for the marker atoms (M are Cr
atoms) for Si growth on (0001) CrSi2 at the minimum primary beam
energy (300 eV) well illustrates this latter possibility [23] (Fig. 1). As
can be seen from Fig. 1, for a 0.2 nm/min Si deposition rate and a 0 to
1/3 Si monolayer (ML) thickness (0–0.117 nm) the M (Cr) Auger peak
extinction is anomalously strong and the S (Si) adsorption is A type one.
However, in the 1/3 to 1 ML Si monolayer thickness range (0.351 nm)
the M peak extinction decelerates abruptly (B type adsorption) and a Si
monolayer forms. Following this the M peak extinction is more mod-
erate and obeys an exponential law, indicating C type adsorption with
the pseudo-layerwise growth of a continuous Si coating.
At low Si deposition rates (0.05 bn/min) the Si atoms initially mix
with the substrate (B type adsorption), followed by C type adsorption a
pseudo-layer type growth of a nonequilibrium wetting CrxSi1-x layer up
to 0.6 nm in thickness. Bulk Si islands form at the final process stage.
The growth models based on the assumption of an exponential ex-
tinction function F and on simplified expressions similar to Eqs. (1)–(3)
describe the above described adsorption types for different growth
stages adequately well [23].
Quantitative Auger analysis of coating growth mechanisms
Theoretical simulation of experimental curves allows quantitative
description of coating growth (the composition and thickness of the
growing layers) provided that the growth mechanism is known or de-
rived from the simulation of experimental curves.
A specific feature of the transition metal coating / silicon substrate
system is the formation of wetting two-dimensional (2D) layers of a
metal or its melt with silicon at an early growth stage and island growth
after the transition of the wetting layer to a bulk (3D) phase. Thus, the
system exhibits either pseudo-layerwise growth for which the layer
continuity is not violated during the 2D–3D transition, or layerwise/
island growth.
Fig. 2 shows Auger peak intensity vs layer thickness for Fe coatings
on (001) Si 2 × 1 arrangement at (a) low and (b) high Fe beam tem-
perature [4]. The substrate Auger peak deviation from the theoretical
layerwise growth curve (dashed curve) provides information on the
growth mechanism. Based on the data on possible growth mechanisms
in the system (see above) one can simulate these growth mechanisms
and choose the best fitting one.
The solid curves in Fig. 2 show the curves for the chosen growth
models at different growth stages (I, II, III).
1. Stage I is the formation of a Fe–Si solid solution caused by the
diffusion of ~1.5 ML Si from the substrate (Fig. 2a) or FeSi silicide
(Fig. 2b).
2. Stage II is the growth of the Fe coating with the segregation of
0.45 ML Si layer (Fig. 2a) or Fe3Si silicide formed by mixing of Fe with
3 ML Si (Fig. 2b).
3. Stage III is the layerwise Fe growth (Fig. 2b).

Iteration Auger analysis of coating thickness and growth mechanism
The iteration procedure contains several sequential approximations
of the coating thickness with an increase in the number of the initial
points of the Auger curve used for the assessment, and with growth
mechanism model correction (Fig. 3) [4].
The zero approximation of the coating thickness (Y axis scale in
Fig. 3) was made based on the data on the first deposited Fe layer (for
submonolayer coatings) in the assumption of a pseudo-layerwise
growth mechanism (curve 1). The Auger peak extinction function was
approximated by the F function (see above) for λ ~ 3 ML probing
depth.
The next depth approximation was based on the several first layers
(points) in a more realistic growth mechanism assumption which fol-
lowed from curve analysis. Then the next growth model was accepted
(curves 2–5). Further approximation and growth models can be made
until the final thickness estimate and growth mechanism model are
accepted.
Simultaneous AES and EELS phase structure analysis
The simultaneous use of AES and EELS with the same probing depth
allows differentiating the phases by composition and atomic density
provided their composition is similar. Similar phase composition means
the same number of electrons in the valence bonds. The plasmon loss
peak position in the EELS spectra determines the concentration of va-
lence electrons per unit volume. Therefore the position of this peak
allows assessing the bulk atomic density of a phase for a constant
composition. If the composition changes gradually during the growth as
confirmed by the AES data, a change in the bulk atomic density during
phase transitions causes a stepwise change of the peak position in the
EELS spectrum.
Moreover, knowing the coating thickness from the AES data one can
make allowance for the substrate EELS signal extinction due to signal
passage through the coating and thus subtract the substrate contribu-
tion from the total EELS spectrum [4]. As a result one can have a more
detailed vision of the EELS spectrum of the coating and changes in the
EELS spectrum of the substrate/coating interface layer if any.
For constant phase composition or density during coating synthesis,
the EELS spectrum correlates with composition changes. For example,
one can observe the formation of a multilayered coating from phases of
different 3d metals. Otherwise there is a correlation with changes in the
atomic density if the coating composition changes gradually (e.g. for
gradual mixing between the coating and the substrate) or remains
constant (growth of pure metal or silicon on silicide). Changes in atomic
density are most expressed in the EELS spectra after the formation of a
2D wetting layer, i.e. its transition to a bulk phase, because the atomic
density of the wetting layer is much different from the bulk atomic
density.
Of special importance for the AES/EELS structural phase analysis is
the probing depth. We found that for the simultaneous AES and EELS
analysis of subnanometer thick coatings (1–10 ML) and their substrate
interfaces the optimum probing depth is 3 ML. This probing depth is
achieved at a primary electron energy of ~300 eV, both for AES and
EELS [4,23,24].
EELS analysis of phase transitions
The composition of a forming interface (Figs. 1–3) changes gradu-
ally. This allows EELS analysis of phase transitions which can be
compared with the AES data on the growth stages.
Fig. 4 shows families of EELS spectra illustrating the changes at the
same Fe / (001) Si substrate interface as in Fig. 2 for different growth
modes, i.e. normal and low-temperature [4]. It can be seen from Fig. 4

that an increase in the coating thickness causes the intensities of some
surface and bulk plasmon loss peaks to increase or decrease. The sub-
strate peaks intensities deplete to zero, and eventually a bulk phase
peak develops. However, this latter peak grows with a delay for rela-
tively thick coatings (typically at least 3 ML).
This delay is also caused by the formation of a 2D wetting layer
having the composition (a) FeSi or (b) Fe + ~1.5 ML Si. This layer does
not have any expressed plasmon loss peaks because of its nanophase
(fine-grained and inonuniform density) structure. The same behavior is
observed for the EELS spectra during the formation of other interfaces,
i.e. Cr/Si(111), Fe/Si(111), Co/Si(111) and Cu/Si(001) [4,23–27].
Thus, the formation of a wetting metal layer on silicon under
nonequilibrium conditions (deposition at room temperature) is a gen-
eral regularity of metal/silicon interface formation. The wetting layer
was not observed earlier because the interface formation was not stu-
died with both AES and EELS in an as detailed and integrated manner as
in this work.
Meanwhile, the formation of a wetting layer is a multistage process
preceded by the formation of various two-dimensional phases with
different atomic densities and compositions.

250 °C state (Fig. 5b). Same as discussed above, the bulk phase for-
mation is delayed (in our case, bulk Fe) due to the formation of a na-
nophase wetting layer. However, annealing makes the wetting layer
density more uniform and, probably, leads to a more ordered (epitaxial)
layer structure. This is indicated by an increase in the plasmon loss peak
intensity seen in Fig. 5b compared to that in Fig. 5a.
Higher annealing temperatures (> 350 °C) produce more ordered
2D phases (SP1 и SP2) and cause wetting layer (WL) and bulk silicide
(BP) epitaxy (Fig. 6). All the phases have specific plasmon loss peak
positions. These peaks are closer to the silicon peaks in the surface
phases and to the bulk silicide peaks in the wetting layer.
Thus, AES and EELS phase structure analysis proves to be important
for studying the formation of heterogeneous interfaces, allowing a more
detailed tracing of interface formation stages under different deposition
conditions.
Furthermore, AES and EELS phase structure analysis allows detecting
atomic density changes which is of great importance for determining the
conditions and mechanism of wetting layer formation and its transition
to the first bulk phase. It also allows tracing the transition from an un-
ordered (amorphous) state to an ordered (epitaxial) one.
EELS phase analysis with substrate contribution subtraction
I noted above that wetting layer formation is a multistage process. A
more detailed vision of this process and the transition to a bulk phase
can be attained by subtracting the substrate contribution to the EELS
spectrum.
Precision evaluation of the substrate contribution is impossible be-
cause other contributions (those of the film and the interface layer) may
change. One can however detract the substrate contribution using
weight coefficients based on the in-depth film AES data or by fitting
these coefficients to retain the shape of the bulk plasmon loss peak in
the as-subtracted spectrum. One can then visualize finer changes in the
spectra and understand which changes occurred in the interface layer
and the film compared with the simple model for the bulk film phase /
substrate without interface layer modification.
Fig. 7 shows EELS spectra for Cu coatings on (001) Si (a) before and
(b) after substrate EELS contribution subtraction [27]. Fig. 8 shows
EELS spectra for (a) Co coatings on (111) Si and (b) Fe coatings on
(001) Si after substrate EELS contribution subtraction [4].
For the Cu coatings (Fig. 7) the subtraction shows that the bulk
plasmon energy loss in the Cu layer is close to the plasmon energy loss
in the bulk Cu or copper silicide phases (17.5 eV) already at a 1 ML
thickness. The subtraction shows well the shift of the surface plasmon
loss peak between the 5th and 6th monolayers for the bulk Cu. The
screening length is ~1 ML in copper and ~2 binary layers in Si. Our
assumption is that the bulk plasmon loss peak position is affected by the
interface silicon layer (at a up to 1 monolayer stage) while the surface
plasmon loss peak position (due to the coupling of the plasmon with the
interface pl;plasmon) is affected by the interface film layer (at a 1–5
monolayers stage).

For the Co and Fe coatings (Fig. 8), the subtraction allows separ-
ating intermediate surface phases (peak B) forming during the forma-
tion of the wetting layer and assessing the thickness range of their
formation. These phases form in subnanolayer coatings and in single
monolayer coatings (peak C), along with the wetting layer (peak D),
typically in the 2 to 3 monolayer range. The allowance for the phase
layer thickness as well as the phase composition, electron density and
growth mechanism provides understanding of the respective phase
growth models. For example, the average electron density in the
wetting layer and the scatter of this density as indicated by the shape of
the bulk plasmon loss peak can be accounted for by a nanophase
structure of the wetting layer. This structure is typical of a set of close-
packed and elastically strained nanoclusters.
Fig. 9 shows the relative intensity of the bulk plasmon loss peak in
the EELS spectrum of the Co coatings on (111) Si for different thick-
nesses [26]. The theoretical curve for pseudo-layerwise growth is the
same for substrate Auger peak extinction (without mixing) and sub-
strate loss peak (with a constant plasma concentration in the interface
layers). Furthermore, Fig. 9 shows the experimental substrate Auger
peak extinction and dashed curves for different plasmon loss peak ex-
tinction stages (1, 2 and 3).
The deviation of the experimental points for the Auger peak from
the theoretical curve for Co layer thicknesses of greater than 1–1.5
monolayers indicates that after this thickness is reached the Co atoms
mixed with Si atoms of the substrate. However, mixing does not occur if
the thickness is within 1 monolayer (stage 1), but the loss peak extinct
much faster than for the perfect model (solid line). Thus, the valence
electron plasma region for which the concentration differs from that of
the substrate broadened toward the substrate. This indicates that the
interface layer with a different valence electron concentration forms in
silicon. This can be caused by a chemical interaction between the Si
interface layer with Co. As a result a two-dimensional covalence bond
region forms between Si and Co (within the Debye screening length),
accompanied by the formation of an elastic nanostructure in the in-
terface layer. Indeed, the subtraction of the substrate spectrum (Fig. 8a)
revealed the formation of surface phases at that stage, with the con-
centration of the valence electrons in these phases being close to that
for silicon but higher.
Stage 2 (1–3 M, Fig. 9) is manifested by the formation (growth) of a
Co wetting layer. The parallel course of the experimental and theore-
tical extinction curves for this stage indicates that no fundamental
changes occurred at the interface during the growth of the wetting
layer. Thus, both the covalence film/substrate bond region and the
elastically strained substrate interface region are retained.
At stage 3 (> 3 ML) the loss intensity extincts in a similar linear
manner but far less slower. This can be caused by the lateral growth of
the Co bulk phase islands and the depletion of the intermediate layer
(the covalence film/substrate bond region and the elastically strained
substrate region) resulting from the wetting layer – bulk phase transi-
tion.

Thus, analysis of the substrate plasmon peak extinction curve pro-
vides information on changes in its interface layer and the mechanism
of the film/ substrate interaction. It is furthermore shown that simple
subtraction of the substrate contribution without interface layer al-
lowance is incorrect.
EELS analysis of multilayered coating growth stages
As noted above, if coatings consist of bulk phases the EELS spectrum
correlates with the coating composition change. Figs. 10 and 11 show
EELS spectra and Auger peak intensities for Cu (8 ML) / Fe (8 ML) / Cu
(5 ML) / Co (10 ML) / Cu (2 ML) multilayered coatings on (001) Si
during their growth [28].
The EELS spectra and the surface and bulk plasmon loss peak po-
sitions in Fig. 10 show the nanolayer growth stages. The growth of Cu,
Co and Fe nanolayers exhibits a early stage of the wetting layer (with an
undistorted bulk plasmon loss peak) and the further bulk layer growth
stage (with the finally established bulk plasmon loss peak). Noteworthy,
only the undistorted bulk plasmon loss peak is observed during the
formation of the first (2 ML thickness, Cu2Si composition as per the AES
data, Fig. 11) and the intermediate (5 ML thick) two-dimensional Cu
layers (AES data, Fig. 11). In the meantime, the formation of the in-
termediate Co layer is accompanied by a sequential formation of CoSi
and Co2Si silicides (Fig. 11) caused by intense interdiffusion with the
substrate (the first three layers were deposited at 250 °C [28]).
These changes would be clearer in higher resolution EELS spectra or
after subtraction of the previous layer contributions. For example, it
would be possible to define more clearly the growth stages by sub-
tracting the previous spectrum from the subsequent one and introdu-
cing the weight coefficient to be proportional to the change of the re-
lative substrate contribution to the spectrum (determined from the AES
data and the growth model).
Interface phase analysis from AES Data
Typically, the Auger spectra contain satellite peaks resulting only
from the energy structure of the valance band. However, analysis of the
satellite plasmon loss peak position in the Auger spectra provides ad-
ditional advantages.
Figs. 12 and 13 show Auger data on the fine structure of the L23VV-
Si peak during the growth of Cr [24] and Fe [4], respectively. The peak
fine structure contains the main L23VV-Si peak and the plasmon satellite
peak formed by the plasma oscillation Auger electron L23VV losses in
the neighborhood of silicon atoms. Since silicon is either in te substrate
or in the coating, this satellite illustrates the silicon neighborhood in te
substrate and in the coating. Thus, it allows differentiating whether
there is mixing between silicon and the metal and tracking density
changes in the vicinity of the silicon atoms.
It can be seen from Fig. 12 that the pure Cr peak grows with an
increase in the coating thickness (especially at the 7×7-Cr phase,
Fig. 12 b) because after the thickness reaches 4 monolayers the plasmon
satellite energy becomes equal to that of pure Cr. Taking into account
the probing depth (~3 ML) this early peak development is possible
provided there is no mixing. However, at 2–3 ML thicknesses a Cr
wetting layer forms because the bulk Cr peak is not yet developed.
Obviously, the peak development stages can be separated by sub-
tracting the substrate contribution from the spectra shown in Fig. 12b.
this naturally requires a higher spectral resolution.
Fig. 13 shows Auger peaks of the Fe coatings on (001) Si grown at
low and high metal flux temperatures. Analysis of the Fe to Si peak
amplitude ratio in Fig. 13 showed that in the former case (low tem-
perature growth) the Fe peak grows without mixing while in the latter
case (high temperature growth) the Fe peak growth is accompanied by
mixing with Si resulting in the formation of FeSi and Fe3Si. The
plasmon satellite position in the former case shows the formation of the
Fe wetting layer and in the latter case the Fe–Si wetting layer. Then
these layers transform to bulk Fe and silicide FeSi phases. The peak in
the 67–75 eV range is related to the bulk plasmon loss L23VV of Auger
electrons at approx. 92 eV. An increase in its energy indicates the for-
mation of a denser bulk Fe phase (Fig. 13a) or denser silicides
(Fig. 13b). The disappearance of that peak in Fig. 13a after 5 ML
thickness can be caused by the formation of a cluster or fine-grained
structure in the Fe coating. Such structures have nonuniform electron
density under these conditions and therefore their peak is smeared and
has low amplitude. However, the plasmon satellite position in Fig. 13b
at ~5–14 ML thicknesses corresponds to the FeSi to Fe transition the
bulk plasmon energies of which are 21 and 25 eV, respectively [29,30].
The increase in the energy of the satellite peak in the 77–80 eV
range attributed to the bulk sp states of Si is caused by an increase in the
number of Fe atoms in the Si neighborhood. The shift of that peak in
Fig. 11. Auger peak intensitites in the AES spectra and layer compositions at different
growth stages of multilayered coatings Cu (8 ML) / Fe (8 ML) / Cu (5 ML) / Co (10 ML) /
Cu (2 ML) on (001) Si [28].

Fig. 13a suggests that after 5 ML thickness the Si atoms have the same
neighborhood as in the bulk Fe phase. The retention of that peak at
12 ML shows that the surface of the bulk Fe phase has a segregated
ultrathin Si layer (~ 0.5 ML according to the AES data). In the mean-
time, the position of that peak in Fig. 13b corresponds to the formation
of FeSi at an early stage (after 5–6 monolayers) and then to the for-
mation of Fe3Si (after 10 monolayers). Thus, for a 5 monolayer thick
coating a Fe and iron silicide wetting layer forms in both cases.
The behavior of the silicon plasmon satellite peak was studied as a
function of Co film thickness on a (111) 7 × 7 Si substrate (Fig. 14).
The experimental data illustrated in Fig. 14 suggest the following
growth stages:
I. formation of a surface phase at 0.2–0.5 ML coating thickness;
II. formation of a Co monolayer at 0.5–1 ML coating thickness;
III. final stage of Co wetting layer formation at 2–3 ML coating thick-
ness.

EELS depth profiling
While EELS analysis does not find general application today, ana-
lysis of energy functions EELS(E) is even less used. This is quite a labor
consuming method requiring thorough methodical development, im-
proved tools and measurement automation. Evidently, though, these
energy functions characterize the diffraction at the lattice planes of the
superficial region, which provides information on the interplane spa-
cing, and the backscattering factor distribution, which characterizes the
atomic composition depth profiles.
As can be seen from Fig. 15, the relative intensity of the elastic peak
function IWL/I0(E) and the plasmon oscillation bulk loss energy function
EBP(E) in fact provide the atomic composition depth profiles of surface
regions and allow measuring atomic layer depths in the wetting layer
WL and the thickness of the silicide layer.
The resultant composition profiles allow modeling the WL layer
which has a thickness of ~12 ML, or about two double layers of the
(111) Si lattice, and contains three Cr layers: one on the surface and two
interstitial intercalated layers.
Summary
Two additional capabilities of the AES and EELS methods were
shown for the characterization of two-dimensional coatings and their
interfaces. These capabilities were demonstrated with a study of early
growth stages of monolayer and multilayere metallic coatings on silicon
and their physical vapor deposition modes.
Compared with the conventional AES and EELS analysis the new
method allows correct comparison between AES data on the composi-
tion and electron energy structure and EELS data on the spatial struc-
ture of valence electrons. The use of the same probing depth for AES
and EELS allows identifying a wetting nanophase layer at its formation
stage and its transition to a bulk phase, as well as the changes occurring
at these stages near the substrate interface.
New capabilities were demonstrated for quantitative Auger analysis
with two probing depths, analysis of plasmon satellite loss peaks in
AES, study of EELS(E) dependence on primary electron energy, marker
atom signal extinction pattern at the interface, EELS spectra with sub-
tracted substrate or coating contribution, and iteration analysis of
coating thickness and growth mechanism.
