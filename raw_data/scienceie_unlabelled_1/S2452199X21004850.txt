In this exploratory work, micrometric radiopaque W–Fe–Mn–C coatings were produced by magnetron sputtering 
plasma deposition, for the first time, with the aim to make very thin Fe–Mn stents trackable by fluoroscopy. The 
power of Fe–13Mn-1.2C target was kept constant at 400 W while that of W target varied from 100 to 400 W 
producing three different coatings referred to as P100, P200, P400. The effect of the increased W power on 
coatings thickness, roughness, structure, corrosion behavior and radiopacity was investigated. The coatings 
showed a power-dependent thickness and W concentration, different roughness values while a similar and 
uniform columnar structure. An amorphous phase was detected for both P100 and P200 coatings while γ-Fe, bcc- 
W and W3C phases found for P400. Moreover, P200 and P400 showed a significantly higher corrosion rate (CR) 
compared to P100. The presence of W, W3C as well as the Fe amount variation determined two different micro- 
galvanic corrosion mechanisms significantly changing the CR of coatings, 0.26 ± 0.02, 59.68 ± 1.21 and 59.06 
± 1.16 μm/year for P100, P200 and P400, respectively. Sample P200 with its most uniform morphology, lowest 
roughness (RMS = 3.9 ± 0.4 nm) and good radiopacity (~6%) appeared the most suitable radiopaque biode-
gradable coating investigated in this study.   
1. Introduction 
Biodegradable metals, a new class of biomaterials, are promising in 
stenting applications. Cardiac biodegradable stents have to sustain 
coronary vessels as long as required and then degrade being catabolized 
by physiological pathways [1]. These tiny devices also require to be 
visible during their implantation. In fact, cardiac stents, tiny expandable 
devices mounted on a balloon catheter, are inserted into a vein, and 
guided under fluoroscopy imaging toward the diseased segment of the 
coronary vessel. Magnesium, zinc and iron-based alloys have been 
investigated as potential metals for biodegradable stents [2]. Today, 
only one biodegradable metal stent has been commercialized in Europe, 
fabricated from a Mg alloy [3]. In this device, two tantalum markers are 
inserted on the extremities of the stent to position the stent under X-ray 
irradiation [4]. However, tantalum is corrosion-resistant; thus, its fate 
upon degradation of the stent in the body is unclear and raises concern. 
Other works used different approaches to increase the radiopacity of 
NiTi stents. For instance, addition of 10 wt% of W [5] was revealed as a 
valid approach, as well as the application of sputtered 5–10 μm Ta 
coatings on NiTi surfaces [6]. In these studies, the Ta and W materials

exhibited a much higher visibility in X-ray images compared with bare 
NiTi stents. 
Fe–Mn–C are biodegradable alloys characterized by a high level of 
formability and acceptable corrosion properties compared to the Mg 
alloys currently used for biodegradable metal stents [7]. Fe–Mn–C alloys 
are ductile and they have a high yielding strength (σY ≈ 620 MPa) which 
make them promising candidates for the fabrication of thin degradable 
stents. This could yield to considerable improvements at the clinical 
implantation step [8]. However, the radiopacity of Fe–Mn–C alloys to 
the X-rays used in interventional fluoroscopy (30–80 keV) and in 
CT-scanning is low (e.g. ρ = 7.72–7.59 g cm− 3; μ/ρ = ~1.50–1.81 cm2 
g− 1 at 50 keV), if compared to more electron-dense alloys (e.g. Co–Cr, ρ 
= 9.27 g cm− 3, μ/ρ = 2.58 cm2 g− 1 at 50 keV) [9,10]. As a result, 
inadequate visibility in fluoroscopy is a major drawback of Fe–Mn–C 
stents, especially for thinner devices. Fluoroscopy is a real-time 
X-ray-imaging technology used during the implantation, whereas 
CT-scan is an X-ray based three-dimensional imaging technique used 
effectively for the post-surgery follow-up of the device. Therefore, one 
promising strategy to improve the radiopacity of Fe–Mn–C alloys is to 
enrich them with radiopaque elements [11] such as tungsten (W). 
Tungsten is a high-density (19.30 g cm− 3) biodegradable element, 
with a relatively greater X-ray attenuation coefficient (5.94 and 7.81 
cm2 g at 50 keV and 80 keV, respectively), compared to both Fe (1.95 
and 0.59 cm2 g at 50 keV and 80 keV, respectively), and Mn (1.71 and 
0.53 cm2 g at 50 keV and 80 keV, respectively) [10–12]. The radiopacity 
of biodegradable Fe–Mn–C devices could be improved by adding W-rich 
coatings, provided these coatings could also biodegrade within a few 
months (typically 6) after implantation. The novelty and impact of the 
proposed approach resides in the development of new and advanced 
radiopaque coatings providing visibility of the whole stent, and not only 
at the two extremities such as with the Ta markers integrated in current 
Mg stents. 
The present study is based on the hypothesis that a Fe–Mn–C foil (or 
wire) coated with a W-rich radiopaque coating, could present similar 
corrosion properties as the base metal (Fe–Mn–C), while providing a 
functional radio-visibility for X-ray interventional fluoroscopy and CT 
imaging. Among several deposition techniques, plasma-based magne-
tron sputtering was selected for its potential to deposit a uniform, highly 
adhesive and strongly cohesive coating by tuning several deposition 
parameters such as sputtering power, pressure of the chamber during the 
deposition and temperature of the substrate [13]. In this study, several 
W–Fe–Mn–C coatings were obtained using co-deposition of W and 
Fe–Mn–C targets by the magnetron sputtering technique. The amount of 
W in the coatings was varied between ~45 at.% and ~87 at.% by using 
sputtering powers applied to the W target from 100W to 400W. The 
effect of chemical composition on the physiochemical and electro-
chemical properties of W–Fe–Mn–C coatings was investigated by several 
characterization techniques. Finally, radiopacity of the coatings, was 
measured by a micro-CT scanner (2D projections as for fluoroscopy). 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Substrates 
For the chemical composition, structure and corrosion character-
ization studies, coatings were deposited on Silicon wafers (CZP<100>, 
Universitywafer Inc., MA, USA). Silicon was selected as the reference 
substrate to assess microstructure, phase structure, thickness, rough-
ness, as well as corrosion behaviour of W–Fe–Mn–C coatings. This sys-
tem allowed a preliminary characterization of the coatings features, e.g. 
an easily assignment of the XRD reflexes and an accurate assessment of 
coating thickness. Pure Fe foil (99.99%, 50 ± 5 μm, Goodfellow, USA) 
was instead selected as substrate to study the radiopacity of the same 
coatings since both thickness and attenuation coefficient of Fe are close 
to those of thin biodegradable stent wiring. Future studies envisage to 
assess radiopaque coating depositions on Fe-based 3D materials to 
consider both the real substrate surface features and its more complex 
geometry. 
2.2. Coating process 
The magnetron sputtering deposition system, equipped with radio- 
frequency (RF) and pulsed DC power supplies, was used to perform 
depositions with a double target system (Plasmionique MS300, Var-
ennes, QC, Canada). DC power source was used for the sputtering a 
tungsten (W) target, whereas RF power source was used for the 
Fe–13Mn-1.2C target (Hadfield steel from Polstar Steel, Mississauga, 
ON, Canada). The base pressure was ~1 × 10− 6 Torr before starting the 
deposition. An Ar (99.9%) working pressure (PW) of 20 mTorr, and a 
deposition time of 60 min were kept throughout the deposition pro-
cedures. The sample holders were set at a distance of 10 cm from the 
center of the targets. Both targets were set at an angle of 30◦ with center 
line of the sample holder. A sputtering power of 400 W was applied on 
the Fe–13Mn-1.2C target while three different powers (100, 200, 400 W) 
were applied on the W target in order to vary the chemical compositions 
of coatings. Since only the tungsten power was varied, samples are 
referred to as P100, P200, and P400 (where the numbers indicate the 
power values adopted for tungsten deposition). 
2.3. Characterization 
Microstructural characterizations of surfaces and cross-sections of 
samples were conducted by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) per-
formed with a FEI Quanta250 SEM system (Thermo-Fisher, OR, USA) 
using a secondary electron detector. The SEM images were acquired 
with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. Topography and roughness of the 
samples were investigated by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM, Dimen-
sion™ 3100, Digital Instrument, CA, USA), operated in tapping mode. 
Elemental analysis of samples was carried out by a micro-X-ray fluo-
rescence spectroscopy system (μ-XRF, Bruker, Tornado M4, USA) 
equipped with a rhodium (Rh) source and two detectors. The acquisi-
tions were performed at E = 50 kV on 3 areas of 1 × 1 mm2 for each 
sample. Crystallographic structure of the coating was assessed by X-ray 
Diffractometry (Siemens® D5000, graphite monochromator, Texas 
USA). Surface elemental analysis was performed by X-ray photoelectron 
spectrometry (PHI 5600-ci, Physical Electronic, MN, USA), with an 
achromatic Al X-ray source, at an incident angle of 45◦ and at a residual 
pressure of 8 × 10− 9 Torr. The analyzed area was 0.5 mm2, and survey 
spectra analyses were done in triplicate. Corrosion behavior was 
investigated by electrochemical tests at room temperature using a mini- 
cell system [14], in modified Hanks’ solution, whose composition and 
preparation were reported elsewhere [15]. The open circuit potential 
(OCP) was recorded for 20 min followed by a potentiodynamic polari-
zation (PDP) test at a scan rate of 0.166 mV/s, in the range - 0.5 to + 0.5 
V. The corrosion rate (μm/year) was calculated according to the estab-
lished protocol reported in Ref. [16]. Five samples per condition were 
used to investigate electrochemical properties. Statistical analyses and 
comparisons among groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA with 
post hoc Tukey test to correct for multiple comparisons. Significance was 
retained when p < 0.05. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of 
the mean. 
2.4. Radiopacity 
The radiopacity of W-rich coatings (1.8 and 4.5 μm thick) deposited 
on 50 μm-thin pure Fe foils, was measured with a X-ray computed micro 
tomography system (CT, eXplore Locus 80, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, 
USA), operated with a W anode and by keeping a fixed angle (vertical 2D 
projections: “0” angle). The samples were embedded in gelatin type A 
(50 g/L in deionized water) and inserted in the CT scanner. The 
following imaging parameters were used: 60 and 80 kVp energies 
(tungsten anode tube voltage), 450 mA current, 100 ms detector

ments were performed on MicroView (Parallax Innovations version:

was calculated as follows [17]:

3. Results and discussion 
Samples of the coated substrates were fractured. Both cross-sections 
and top-views were visualised in SEM (Fig. 1a–i). The coatings produced 
at three different sputtering powers (P100, P200 and P400; corre-
sponding to the three different powers of 100, 200 and 400 W, respec-
tively), had power-dependent thicknesses and W concentrations, while 
showing similar columnar structures (Fig. 1a–c). Thickness values of 0.9 
± 0.2 μm, 1.3 ± 0.1 μm and 1.8 ± 0.2 μm were found for P100, P200 and 
P400, respectively, (Fig. 1a–c). No evidence of cracking was found on 
the sample surfaces (Fig. 1d–f). In addition, both P100 and P200 samples 
showed a relatively uniform structure, whereas, in the case of P400 
samples, a microstructure composed of two different morphologies was 
found (Fig. 1i): Pyramidal crystallites emerging from a smoother base 
were evident both from SEM and AFM analyses (Fig. 1i and l). In 
particular, AFM analysis (Figure 1l) clearly showed the microstructure 
typical of P400 samples where the height of the crystallites could be in 
the range of 50–60 nm. In fact, roughness values (RMS, 2 × 2 μm2) of 
P100 (3.9 ± 0.4 nm) and P200 (6.1 ± 1.0 nm) did not significantly differ,

while RMS increased up to 54.3 ± 8.1 nm for the coating obtained at the 
highest W sputtering power (P400). The differences observed in coating 
microstructures can be correlated to the amounts of tungsten and other 
elements in the coating deduced from XRF analysis (Table 1). Increasing 
the sputtering power during the deposition increased the W content 
(three times higher for P400 sample) while drastically decreased Fe and 
Mn amounts. 
The effect of a higher amount of W on the crystallographic structure 
of the coatings was assessed by XRD measurements. The XRD patterns 
revealed for P100 and P200 coatings, did not show clear reflexes 
(Fig. 2b), with the exception of a wide reflection at 2θ = 42◦, indicative 
of the presence of amorphous phase. In the P400 coating however, Bragg 
reflex corresponding to γ-Fe (111) and bcc W (110) were clearly 
observed. The presence of a reflex at 2θ = ~37◦ was attributed to the 
formation of tungsten carbide (W3C), which could be associated to the 
pyramidal structures found on the surface of the sample, as evidenced by 
SEM and AFM images (Fig. 1f and i). The presence of C in W coatings 
produced by sputtering, is known to promote the formation of W-rich 
metallic carbides [18]. Also, traces of γ-Fe (2θ = ~44◦) were deduced in 
the P400 sample XRD spectra, as Mn is well-known as a stabilizer of 
austenitic iron [2]. Furthermore, Fe can accelerate the formation of 
tungsten carbide [19]. 
XPS analyses of the samples and Fe–Mn–C target were shown in 
Fig. 3. The Mn/Fe weight ratio of Fe–13Mn-1.2C target used for sput-
tering was ~0.15. However, XPS results showed (Fig. 3) that on the 
outermost layer of the coating the Mn/Fe ratio varied from ~0.25, to0.5 
and ~1.0 for P400, P100 and P200, respectively. Thus, the upper surface 
of the coatings (~5 nm) is richer in Mn, compared with the material of 
the sputtered target (Fe–13Mn-1.2C) and this independently from the 
power used to sputter the W target (100, 200, and 400 W). Both XPS 
(Fig. 3 and Table 2) and XRF (Table 1) analyses confirmed the increase 
of W in coatings along with the sputter power applied to the W target. As 
a result, the total amount of metallic elements (∑ = W + Mn + Fe) on 
the surface increased from 16.96 ± 0.76 at. %, to 20.93 ± 1.13 at. %, and 
to 28.20 ± 0.92 at. % for P100, P200 and P400, respectively. However, 
the W/(W + Fe + Mn) ratio was 0.36 ± 0.02, 0.48 ± 0.3 and 0.81 ± 0.3 
for P100, P200 and P400, respectively. By opposition, the Fe/(W + Fe +
Mn) decreased at higher tungsten deposition power. Comparing Mn/Fe 
ratio of the surface of the coating with Fe–Mn–C target, it was noticed 
that P400 presented lower Mn/Fe ratio led to conclude that there is an 
Mn depletion for P400. In conclusion, the outermost surface of sample 
P400 showed a lower content of O1s and Mn2p3, higher content of W4f 
compared to other conditions. The difference in the chemical composi-
tion of surface of the coating at higher deposition power can strongly 
affect its corrosion behavior. 
The corrosion behavior of the different samples was assessed by 
testing 5 samples per condition (Fig. 4). First, the OCP curves showed 
that after 600 s, all curves achieved a stabilization potential (Fig. 4a). 
However, the potential plateaus were different for the three considered 
conditions, showing a general decrease for higher amounts of W. In fact, 
samples P200 and P400 showed a potential shift to more negative 
values, indicating a higher electrochemical activity at their surface.

corrosion rate (CR) [20]. The calculated CR, on the basis of Tafel 
extrapolation, increased drastically with increasing W sputtering powers 
from 0.26 ± 0.02 μm/year for P100 to 59.6 ± 1.2 μm/year for P200 and 
59.0 ± 1.1 μm/year for P400 sample. The results showed that there was 
no significant difference between CR of P200 and P400. Compared to the 
sample P100, it was possible to notice that the anodic curve of the 
samples P200 and P400 shifts to higher current density values, indi-
cating a higher anodic dissolution of the metal. Increasing the corrosion 
rate could be related to the difference in the standard potential of W 
(− 0.04 V), which was higher in comparison with that of pure iron 
(− 0.44 V), and could be considered to act as a superior cathode [21]. In 
this case, W was functionalized as a cathode and the Fe acted as the

anode to generate micro-galvanic corrosion. Increasing the W amount 
increased the cathodic areas and micro-galvanic sites what could explain 
the highest corrosion rates. However, increasing the W amount did not 
increase the CR of P400 samples while P200 was more prone to corro-
sion compared to P400. It seems that both the presence of W3C and the 
higher surface roughness of P400 sample have a dominant effect on the 
corrosion properties of this alloy rather than the effect of a higher 
amount of W. It was reported by Pradhan et al. that the depth of pene-
tration of the corrosive solution increased with the surface roughness 
and the electron release rate was also significantly higher for a rougher 
surface. For this reason, coating CR increased with the real surface area 
[22]. Tungsten carbide increased the CR of the Fe-based alloy coating. 
However, increasing the mass fraction of the fragile tungsten carbide 
phase leads to holes and other defects that can increase the CR of coating 
[23]. 
Attenuation of X-rays by the coatings was measured by a microCT 
scanner with a tungsten anode X-ray tube operated at 60 kVp and 80 
kVp. The results of these radiopacity tests are reported in Fig. 5. The 2D 
projection images, from which the contrast results were extracted (at “0” 
degree angle in the CT scanner), are inserted in Fig. 5. More radiopaque 
Fe foils were obtained by applying higher sputtering powers at the W 
target, which led also to thicker coatings. The maximum radiopacity was 
achieved for the P400 sample (4.5 ± 0.2 μm thick on a 50 μm-Fe foil), 
measured at 80 kVp, with a 7.6% contrast between coated and uncoated 
Fe foil. At 60 kVp the contrast measured for the P400 sample decreased 
to 7.1%, in spite of the presence of the k-edge of W at 69 keV. This very 
slight decrease in contrast between the 80 kVp and 60 kVp operation 
modes, reflects the broad range of the energy spectrum of photons 
produced by the tungsten anode tube. In fact, this range of photon en-
ergies is relatively similar to that observed in fluoroscopy systems in the 
stenting clinics. Interestingly, in the thinner coatings (1.8 ± 0.2 μm), and 
at the highest sputtering powers used for W (400 W), a decrease in 
contrast was observed by changing from 60 kVp to 80 kVp. Although the 
80 kVp maximum tube energy is well above the k-edge of W, the amount 
of tungsten in the thin coatings in not sufficient to generate a significant 
attenuation effect. As a result, more photons pass through the coated Fe 
foils at 80 kVp compared with the 60 kVp condition, and thus lower 
contrasts are found at higher X-ray tube energies. Pure Fe has an 
attenuation coefficient of 1.205 cm2/g at 60 keV, and 0.595 cm2/g at 80 
keV [10]. These findings were compared to the radiopacity of conven-
tional Co–Cr (L605) stents. In this alloy, the presence of 15 wt% tungsten 
provides optimal visibility in fluoroscopy [24]. To increase the visibility 
of pure Fe foils, this weight percentage of tungsten should be integrated 
to thickness of the 50 ± 5 μm of Fe foils treated in the present study. The 
concentration of W achieved in the (4.5 ± 0.2 μm) coatings was 60.70 ±
0.06 wt % for P200 and 87.45 ± 0.06 wt% for P400. The thickness of the 
coatings represents 8.25% of the total section of the deposited sub-
strates. The total weight percentage of W found in each one of the 
coatings, multiplied to the relative section of the coatings, points to an 
approximate weight concentration of 5.01 wt% and 7.22 wt% equiva-
lent W in the deposited Fe substrates. Hence in order to reach the same 
level of X-ray visibility in Fe alloys imaged in fluoroscopy as that pro-
duced by 15 wt%. W in conventional CoCr alloys, the sputtered 
W–Fe–Mn–C coatings should be at least 2 or 3 times thicker. Therefore, 
based on the literature related to radiopaque coatings [6] and the results 
obtained in the present study W–Fe–Mn–C coatings at least 10 μm thick 
would be necessary to achieve visibility. In this light, 4–5 μm thick 
coatings can be applied on both sides of the Fe–Mn stents to provide 
optimum radiopacity. In the clinics, the efficient tracking of stents in 
fluoroscopy require the objects to be visualised at to contrast of at 300 
Hounsfield unit (HU), while the contrast of blood containing iodine 
(contrast agent) is 200 HU [25,26]. The next step of this work will 
consist in developing 3D objects with a W-rich coating, for visualization 
in both fluoroscopy and X-ray CT-scanning. It should be mentioned that 
the geometry of the stent has an important effect on the coating thick-
ness, columnar growth angle, and porosity. Therefore, in the next step of 
this work a comprehensive study will be done to put into evidence the 
effect of stent geometry on the properties of the coatings. 
4. Conclusions 
Micrometric coatings of W–Fe–Mn–C alloy were deposited on Si 
wafers and Fe-foils by magnetron co-sputtering of Fe–13Mn-1.2C and W. 
The increase of the sputtering power of W from 100 W to 400 W varied 
the W amount found on sample surfaces, from 45.6 ± 0.7 to 87.5 ± 0.2 
wt%. SEM and AFM studies evidenced a change in the coatings thick-
ness, morphology and roughness by increasing the amount of tungsten. 
Thickness values of 0.9 ± 0.2 μm, 1.3 ± 0.1 μm and 1.8 ± 0.2 μm were 
found for P100, P200 and P400, respectively. W3C phase was found just 
in the P400 sample. The presence of W, W3C, as well as the variation of 
Fe amount in the coating chemical composition, changed sample 
corrosion rate from 0.26 ± 0.02 to 59.68 ± 1.21 and 59.06 ± 1.16 μm/ 
year. In particular, P200 and P400 showed a higher CR compared to 
P100. Two different kinds of micro-galvanic corrosion mechanism were 
found to increase the corrosion rate of P200 and P400. In the case of 
P400 both the higher roughness and the presence of W and W3C as 
cathodic sites played an important role in increasing the CR of the 
coating. Sample P200 displayed the most uniform morphology, low 
roughness (6.1 ± 1.0 nm) and high corrosion rate (59.68 ± 1.21 μm/ 
year), and also it provided acceptable radiopacity (~6%) compared to 
other conditions. In this light, W–Fe–Mn–C coating obtained by 
magnetron co-sputtering of Fe–13Mn-1.2C (400 W) and W (200 W) 
could be considered as presuming candidate for the development novel 
radiopaque degradable coatings on biodegradable Fe–Mn based im-
plants. W–Fe–Mn–C coatings at least 10 μm thick would be necessary to 
achieve visibility. The obtained 4.5 μm thick coatings can be applied on 
both sides of the Fe–Mn stents to provide optimum radiopacity.
