Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), has caused more than 179 million infections and 3.8 million deaths worldwide. Global health
authorities working on the COVID-19 outbreak continue to explore methods to reduce the rate of its transmission
to healthy individuals. Treatment protocols thus far have focused on social distancing and masking, treatment
with antivirals early in infection, and steroids to reduce the inflammatory response. An alternative approach is
therapy with low dose radiation (LDR), which has several advantages compared to the current drugs and med-
icines. To date more than 10 case reports and pilot clinical trial preliminary outcome are available from different
countries. These reports cover a wide range of patient conditions and LDR treatment strategies. Although one
report showed the failure to observe the improvement of COVID-19 patients after LDR therapy, the majority
showed some clinical improvement, and demonstrated the safety of LDR for COVID-19 patients, particularly with
0.5 Gy. This review aims to summarize the potential rationales and mechanisms of LDR therapy for COVID-19
patients, and its current clinical status and potential use.1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
causative pathogen of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has
caused more than 179 million infections and 3.8 million deaths world-
wide.1 Global health authorities working on the COVID-19 outbreak
continue to explore methods to reduce the rate of its transmission to
healthy individuals. Viruses typically have different sensitivities to
physical and chemical treatments, such antiviral drugs, UV, and heat,
ranging from extremely sensitive to extremely resistant. Incomplete
treatment of individuals provides evolutionary pressure on the viral
genome, leading to the generation of more resistant organisms. An
alternative approach is therapy with low dose radiation (LDR). As sug-
gested in by Ghadimi-Moghadam et al.,2 COVID-19 patients may receive
a single dose of 100, 180 or 250 mGy X-rays, less than the maximum
annual radiation dose of the residents of high background radiation areas
of Ramsar (<260 mSv). In contrast with antiviral drugs, a single dose of
either 100, 180 or 250 mSv of low LET X-rays may not exert a significant
selective pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 and hence does not lead to directed
accelerated evolution of these viruses.
The concept of LDRT for COVID has been evaluated by several groupsute, 570 South Preston Street, Rm

This review aims to summarize the potential rationales or mechanisms,

2. LDR induced hormesis and adaptive response, and its
application to treat phenomena historically
In the context of radiation protection and many fields of radiobiology,
‘low dose’ is understood to be 100 mGy or less. However, in the field of
radiation oncology where the daily dose fraction is typically 2 Gy, and 6
weeks of therapy amounts to a total dose of 60 Gy (2 Gy/d  5 d/
week  6 weeks), a single 1.0 Gy is regarded as a low dose.3 LDR has
distinct effects from high dose radiation (HDR): the latter causes massive
DNA damage, cell death, organ damage, and can even cause acute radi-
ation sickness. In contrast, LDR, particularly at the 100 mGy or less, does: 304F, Louisville, KY, 40202, USA.

stimulate DNA repair enzyme activity, anti-stress proteins and apoptotic
cell death pathways, in an effort to reduce genomic instability4,5 as
observed non-ionizing radiation genotoxic agent.6 This has led to two
described impacts of LDR: “hormesis”, which is stimulating cell function
and cellular signaling pathways, and “adaptive response” which is the
development of resistance to subsequent chemical or physical stress.3–5
In the last seven decades, LDR hormetic and adaptive effects have
been confirmed in a variety of animal (preclinical) models,7-9 and have
also been gradually applied in clinics.10 For instance, a pilot trial of LDR
via diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT, 40–60 mGy) to treat patient
with Alzheimer's disease was been started in 2016,11–13 which has led to
a NIH trial being approved for LDR therapy for patient with Alzheimer's
disease (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03597360 for CT).
Dr. Calabrese has offered a nice review regarding the historical
application of X-ray therapy of pneumonia during the first half of the
20th century. He has collected 15 studies with approximately 700 cases
of bacterial (lobar and bronchopneumonia), sulfanilamide non-
responsive, interstitial, and atypical pneumonia, showing the effective
treatment by low dose (LD) X-rays, based on clinical symptoms, objective
disease biomarkers, andmortality incidence. He found the capacity of the
X-ray treatment to reduce mortality was similar to serum therapy and
sulfonamide treatment during that time period. In his review, he also
provided four experimental animal models (mice, guinea pig, cat, and
dog) with bacterial and viral pneumonia to confirm the clinical obser-
vation and outcomes. X-ray treatment of these pneumonia is hypothe-
sized to induce an anti-inflammatory phenotype to rapidly reverse
clinical symptoms and facilitate disease resolution. This experience with
both bacterial and viral pneumonias in the past suggests the possibility
that LDRT could have an impact on COVID-19 as well.14
3. LDRT for the patients with COVID-19: its potential rationales
and mechanisms
SARS-CoV-2 infects the lower respiratory system resulting in the
recruitment of macrophages and monocytes to the lung as inflammation
that further causes widespread damage to the lung's airways.1,15 Similar
to other beta-corona viruses, SARS-CoV-2 requires the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entering the
cells. ACE2 receptor expresses most cells in our body, including
vascular endothelial cells, the renal tubular epithelium, Leydig cells in
the testes, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and heart. However, SARS-CoV-2
most commonly affects the lungs of the patients with COVID-19, 20% of
which becomes severe and results in ARDS or sepsis due to a cytokine
storm. It is well-known that there remains insufficient therapy for the
patients with COVID-19, making it highly lethal. Even though vacci-
nations are available from several countries, this prevalence and140mortality remain high and new variants of SARS-CoV-2 are appearing
rapidly, all these will continually spread it and threaten the world.1,15
Thus, alternative efficient approaches to prevent and treat the patients
with COVID-19 remain urgently needed, among which LDRT was one
proposed with several reasons, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
As early as March 20, 2020, a preprint from Mohan Doss suggested
application of LDRT for the patients with COVID-19 (https://osf.
io/6zy9u/),16 following which, other two hypotheses immediately
appeared on April 1, 2020 from Ghadimi-Moghadam et al.,2 and on April
6 as the early online version from Kirkby & Mackenzie.17 Doss remarked
that the SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to pneumonia and death, for
which the weakness of the immune system would be the major contrib-
uting factors; therefore, it is necessary for some pilot clinical trials to
explore LDRT with dose of 300 mGy for the lungs to boot systemic im-
mune function and anti-inflammation.16 Ghadimi-Moghadam et al.2 also
introduced the similar propose for COVID-19 patients to receive a single
dose of 100, 180 or 250 mSv X-ray radiation since that is less than the
maximum annual radiation dose of the residents of high background
radiation areas of Ramsar that is up to 260 mSv.
Subsequently there were several publications suggesting the appli-
cation of LDRT for the patients with COVID-19 with different reasons and
historical evidence. Fig. 2 summarized the potential rationales or
mechanisms responsible for the LDRT for these patients.
3.1. LDR and its anti-inflammation and immuno-stimulation
One goal of the therapy of COVID-19 patients is to stimulate the pa-
tient's immune function to kill the virus, but suppress the cytokine storm
that leads to severe pulmonary injury.18 Although multiple drugs are
being tested to treat COVID-19 patients, there are no drugs that have
been approved by FDA to successfully treat severe cases of COVID-19.
LDR has historically demonstrated robust effectiveness on viral pneu-
monia.14 Immunologically LDRT is able to induce IL-10 and TGF-β to
enhance the immuno-suppressive effects and is also able to increase CD4
and CD8 T-cell counts. Hypothetically LDRT appears to negate the effects
of cytokine release syndrome through immunomodulation.
The cytokine storm associated with severe COVID 19 patients has
been considered as the cause of death in these sick patients.18,19 Based on
Kumar et al.,18 Table 1 lists the typical changes of cytokines in the pa-
tients with COVID-19, including decreases in CD3, CD4, CD8, NK cells
and B-cells, decrease in IL-10 and IFN-γ, but increases in IL-4, IL-6 and
TNF-α. In contrast, LDR-induced responses include an increase in CD3,
CD4, and CD8 T cells, increases in IL-10 and TGF-β, decreases in IL-6 and
TNF-α, and M2 macrophage phenotype activation.18 Genard et al.20 also
summarized literature to point out that LDR at<1.0 Gy maintaining high
level of M2microphage compared to radiation at medium dose (2–10 Gy)
showing predominant M1 macrophage.
Consistent with the report of Kumar et al.,18 the stimulating effect of
LDR in animal models has been reported before,21,22 which demonstrated
that LDR can stimulate proliferation of normal cells and activate their
defense systems. The preclinical and clinical studies of the specific effects
of LDR on the immune system indicate potential efficacy in the treatment
of some immune-related diseases, especially autoimmune diseases and
malignant tumors.22 Most recently, Meziani et al.23 also conducted a
comprehensive study in mouse model and human tissue samples. In this
study, the authors used airways-instilled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
influenza virus (H1N1) as murine models of pneumonia, and Toll-like
receptor (TLR)-3 stimulation in human lung macrophages. LDRT (0.5
or 1 Gy) decreased LPS induced pneumonia, and increased the percent-
age of nerve- and airway-associated Macrophages producing IL-10. LDR
treatment decreased H1N1 viral infection-induced lung tissue damage
and immune cell infiltration in animals and LDRT also increased IL-10
production by infiltrating immune cells into the lung. Exposure of
TLR-3 ligand-stimulated human lung macrophages ex vivo to LDR
increased IL-10 secretion and decreased IFNγ and IL-6 production.
Therefore, these results also support the concept that LDR-mediated

Note： Information cited in this table predominantly from the review by Kumer
et al.,18 otherwise was indicated in the table. M1 & M2 are two types of mac-
rophages: M1 macrophages are recognized as classically activated macrophages
and show enhanced ability to phagocyte pathogens while M2 macrophages are
requested in infection-free healing circumstances and have pro-tumoral func-
tions. The polarization of macrophages can be driven by different
micro-environmental molecules and leads to the production by the macrophages
of different cytokines and chemokines.20
N.E. Dunlap et al. Radiation Medicine and Protection 2 (2021) 139–145immune homeostasis with reduction of inflammatory response is most
likely the mechanisms by which LDRT afford the therapy for the patients
with COVID-19.23
3.2. LDR induced adaptive or hormetic responses showing the resistance of
multiple organs to virus-infection caused damages
Except for the above anti-inflammatory and immuno-stimulatory ef-
fects, LDRT may also induce systemic tissues' adaptive or hormetic
response, making the tissues resistant to the challenge by virus. Oxidative
stress is actively involved in the pathogenic process of respiratory viral
infections, therefore, preventing the cytokine storm that rapidly gener-
ates extra amounts of reactive oxygen species would be an important step
to prevent multi-organ damage.1,15 Antioxidant therapy has been proven
to most probably increase the effectiveness of the response against
SARS-CoV-2.24 Recent studies have clearly shown the upregulation of
oxidative stress gene markers during SARS-COV-2 viral infection and is
under consideration as a predictor for COVID-19 severity and the dura-
tion of ICU stay.25,26 Specifically, the COVID-19-associated oxidative
damage to red blood cells has been reported in 9-year-old boy with
COVID-19 symptom and positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.27 In samples from
the lung, heart, and liver in a recent prospective cohort of 15 postmortem
patients who died from COVID-19, manganese superoxide dismutase
(MnSOD) was shown in both mitochondria and cytosol, suggesting that
this enzyme may not sufficiently detoxify the reactive oxygen or nitrogen
species in mitochondria, leading to an increased oxidation of mito-
chondrial proteins.28 The NRF2 antioxidant gene expression pathway is141suppressed in biopsies obtained from COVID-19 patients29; leading to the
hypothesis that activation of NRF2 has potential for treating COVID-19.30
Calabrese et al.31 recently have addressed NRF2 activation as the
responsible etiology for the clinical benefits of LDRT in COVID-19
pneumonia. In our early studies we have provided evidence for the in-
duction of NRF232,33 and its down-stream antioxidants, including SOD,34
in various tissues of animals by LDR, which prevented diabetes-induced
organ's damages. LDR-induced NRF2 and its downstream antioxidants
not only offers the prevention of oxidative stress and damage caused by
SARS-CoV2 infections, but also favorably rebalances the skewed oxida-
tive redox homeostasis of immunological cells, driving them toward
anti-inflammatory phenotypes.31 At the cellular and subcellular levels,
hormetic doses of LDR (<1.0 Gy) induce polarization shifts in the pre-
dominant population of lung macrophages, from an M1
pro-inflammatory to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype.20,31 Intracel-
lularly in response to LDR at 0.1 Gy, cytosolic CDK4 relocates to mito-
chondria where it directly phosphorylates MnSOD at serine-106 (S106)
to activate MnSOD enzymatic activity and mitochondrial respiration.35
This LDR-mediated mitochondrial MnSOD activation and respiration
make the cells more resistant to second high-dose radiation-induced
damage in vitro and in vivo.35 Therefore, LDRT may protect patients with
COVID-19 from SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxicity not only by activating
NRF2-mediated transcriptional function for increasing its downstream
antioxidants, but also by enhancing antioxidant activities through stim-
ulating posttranscriptional modification of these anti-oxidative enzymes.
Together, the NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and the subsequent
shifts to anti-inflammatory phenotypes would have the capacity to sup-
press cytokine storms, resolve inflammation, promote tissue repair, and
prevent COVID-19-related mortality.31
3.3. Stimulating stem cell proliferation to repair the damage organs
Infection of cells with SARS-CoV2 leading to the host cell damage and
death.1,15 The repairing of these damaged or lost cells is an important
step to recover from the infection-mediated ARDS; accordingly, thera-
peutic strategies with different kinds of stem cells have been
explored.1,36,37 The capacity for LDR at 75 mGy to 0.5 Gy to stimulate
bone marrow progenitor cells has been demonstrated in our early
works,38,39 and its therapeutic effects on damaged tissues also were re-
ported from our group,40 and others.41,42
Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-
ranging immunomodulatory activities.43 As summarized by Rogers
et al.,43 MSCs function via several mechanisms relevant to acute lung
injury: when MSCs are administered intravenously, these cells sequester
in the lung, but are immune-modulatory, anti-inflammatory,

142antibacterial, and antiviral. They additionally are anti-lung fibrosis,
anti-apoptosis of injured cells, and stimulate alveolar fluid clearance and
lung tissue regeneration. These functions of MSCs have been confirmed
by multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung
models, and furthermore, the in vivo safety of local and intravenous
administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clin-
ical trials, including studies of ARDS.43
ADSCs, an abundant type of MSCs, are proposed as a therapeutic
option for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in order to reduce
morbidity and mortality.43,44 We and others have indicated that LDR
0.1 Gy was able enhance the proliferation of several human normal cell
lines and animal bone-marrow stem cells in vivo, but not that of tumor
cells, establishing a precedent for using LDR to stimulate stem cell
therapies.45–48 A recent elegant study with human ADSCs isolated from
10 donors has shown that LDR (50 mGy) promoted the proliferation and
survival of ADSCs. LDR at dose of1.0 Gy did not have either genomic or
cytotoxic effects detectable, but at greater doses (0.1–2.0 Gy) induced
residual double-strand breaks and reduced the long-term survival and
proliferation rate of ADSCs.44 These studies suggest that LDR could be a
possible mediator to improve stem cells in potential therapy for the pa-
tients with COVID-19.
In summary, there are multiple potential mechanisms by which LDRT
may provide beneficial effects in patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials
are needed to assess if these theoretical benefits will translate into
improved outcomes.
4. Current status of LDRT for COVID-19 patients
As of August 16, 2021, 17 different groups have registered LDRT trials
for COVID-19 in ClinicalTrials.gov (Search of: low dose radiation, ther-
apy | Covid19 - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov). Among these clinical
trials, four have competed, two are the status of “Active not recruiting”
and the rest are “Recruiting”. One of the four completed clinical trials is
the only clinical trial to explore “Inhalation Low Dose Radionuclide
Therapy in Treatment COVID-19 (NCT04724538)”, for which Inhalation
of 99Tcm-pertechnetate aerosol from commercial gas generator that was
loaded by 4,165 MBq of 99Tcm -pertechnetate. Computed tomography
(CT) scans and blood tests were conducted at 1 d before, 7 and 14 d after
inhalation procedure for both 14 treated COVID-19 patients and 11 non-
treated COVID-19 patients. The final analyzed results are expected soon.
Within the literature, there are 9 publications for the case report or
clinical trials available regarding the use of LDRT with COVID-19, which
are summarized in Table 2.
As the first report for the use of LDRT to the patients with COVID-19,
Ameri et al. published a pilot study in 2020,49 and second study in
2021.50 In the first study, they treated five patients with COVID-19 aged
over 60 years with whole lung exposure to 0.5 Gy. They reported the
improvement of four patients within a few days after irradiation, with an
average discharging time of 6 days and no obvious radiation toxicity. In
the subsequent study, they treated 10 COVID-19 patients with different
dose patterns: 5, 1 and 4 patients with a single 0.5 Gy as did in first study,
two 0.5 Gy with interval of 48–72 h, and a single dose of 1.0 Gy,
N.E. Dunlap et al. Radiation Medicine and Protection 2 (2021) 139–145respectively. The mean improvements in blood oxygen level at 1 and 2 d
after LDRT were 2.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Nine patients were treated
after 1 d. Overall, the response rate (RR, defined as an increase in blood
oxygen level) of these patients and clinical recovery (CR) were 63.6%
and 55.5%, respectively.50
In August 2020 Del Castillo et al.51 reported treatment of a 64-year
old patient with COVID-19 with 1.0 Gy whole lungs exposure and
found the significant improvement at 3 d post-LDRT, discharged to home
at 7 d post-LDRT.
In September 2020, the first pilot study from Hess et al.52 was
available, in which they treated five patients with COVID-19 with a
single dose (1.5 Gy) whole lungs exposure. They found that the respi-
ratory condition of four patients improved in the first 24 h after exposure
with an average recovery time as 1.5 d and discharge time of 12 d. There
were no obvious acute radiation toxicities. By comparing the blood tests
and imaging examinations the effectiveness of LDRT for patients
COVID-19 is estimated about 80%.52 Then they treated another 10 pa-
tients with 1.5 Gy whole lung exposure. By comparing with 10 control
patients with and without other COVID-19 drugs, three key variables
including the median times for clinical recovery and hospital discharge,
and intubation rates were 3 vs. 12 d, 12 vs. 20 d, 10% vs 40% (LDRT vs.
Control), respectively.53
Sanmamed et al.54 treated 9 COVID-19 patients with whole lung
exposure to 1.0 Gy and demonstrated that SatO2/FiO2 index significantly
improved 3 d post-LDRT. Compared to COVID-19 patients without LDRT,
the median days of hospitalization of patients who received LDRT was
reduced by approximately 20%. Seven patients were discharged and two
patients died in the hospital; the reasons for death were sepsis and severe
baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Sharma et al. performed LDRT to treat 10 patients with COVID-19
with an age range of 38–63 years. Both lungs of these patients were
irradiated by a single-dose fraction (0.7 Gy). All patients completed the
prescribed treatment. Nine patients achieved CR within a period ranging
from 3 to 7 d, and discharged from hospital with the range of 10–24 d
after LDRT. One patient died 24 d after LDRT. No radiation toxicity was
observed in these patients. Overall, RR of these patients was 90%.55
Under the same clinical trial, IPACOVID (NCT04380818),56,57 Bonet
et al.56 have first optimized the procedure of LDRT for the patients with
COVID-19. They were able to perform LDRT in a median of 38 min,
suggesting that LDRT could be performed safely and easily. Then they
treated 36 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (a mean age of 84 years,
19 men and 17 women) with 0.5 Gy LDRT along with dexamethasone
treatment. Significant improvements compared to before treatment were
achieved, as shown by improvements in oxygen saturations and amount
of supplemental oxygen needed. In those who survived (23/36, 64%), a
significant improvement was observed in the percentage of lung
involvement in the CT scan at 1 week after LD-RT. No adverse effects
related to radiation treatment have been reported. Through these two
studies, they conclude that LDRT is a feasible and safe option in a pop-
ulation with COVID-19 in the presence of significant comorbidities.57
The above clinic studies on LDRT for the patients with COVID-19
generally showed the improved and safe outcomes (Table 2); however,
the outcome of Papachristofilou et al.58 is different from the above
clinical outcomes. In this study, 22 patients were randomized to either
whole-lung LDRT or sham-radiation therapy. They did not observe a
difference in 15-d ventilator-free days or overall survival at 28 d between
the two arms. In this study, whole-lung LDRT failed to improve clinical
outcomes in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation for
COVID-19 pneumonia.58 This discrepancy was discussed for the potential
confounders or issues.58,59
In summary, performing LDRT is a new approach to treat pneumonia
resulting from COVID-19 disease.60 The completed clinical trials that
have performed LDRT to treat COVID-19 showed that the effectiveness of
LDRT in treating COVID-19 was up to 90%. The vast majority of primary
and secondary outcomes of clinical trial investigations regarding LDRT in
treating COVID-19 found that LDRT can be considered a feasible143treatment to improve mortality of COVID-19 patients.
5. Perspectives
In the past century there has been substantial evidence from studies of
intended and unintended irradiation of animals and humans demon-
strating the harmful effects of radiation at high doses. However, LDR at
100 mGy or lower is not only harmless, but can be beneficial with
decreased rates of cancer and increased longevity.4,10,21,22 Historically,
X-rays have been used to successfully treat bacterial and atypical
(including viral) pneumonia.19,31 As summarized by Calabrese and
Dhawan,31 a single treatment with LD X-rays quickly relieved respiratory
distress and markedly reduced the risk of mortality in patients with
pneumonia, especially when given early in the disease course. The re-
ported total cure rate reached 83.1% among a total of 863 pneumonia
patients treated by X-ray therapy, including 85 virus-induced pneu-
monia; the reduced pneumonia mortality was similar to those treated by
immune serum and sulfonamide. From the limited clinical trials
(Table 2), LDRT in the most of cases appears to reduce or significantly
relieve the course of severe pneumonia.
With regard to the biologic effects of LDR, Torres Royo et al.61 sum-
marized the previous studies on LDRT for benign pathologies with the
conclusion that the net effect at doses of 0.1–0.3 Gy are
anti-inflammatory actions. This is consistent with another comprehen-
sive review, stating that low (<0.1 Gy) to moderate doses (0.1–1.0 Gy) of
low and high LET radiation have anti-inflammatory effects on individuals
with local inflammatory conditions, and may result in improvement in a
variety of clinical symptoms and parameters.62 Therefore, LDRT would
offer a low-risk, noninvasive, therapeutic alternative for elderly patients,
with low toxicity. Currently it is only considered as a rescue treatment for
the patients with COVID-19 when standard management has failed.61
There remain several questions need to be further addressed in the
future clinical trials. The first question is the dose level of LDRT for the
patients with COVID-19. Several clinical trials showed improvement for
the therapy of COVID-19 patients with dose range of 1.5 to 0.5 Gy
(Table 2). Although the observation of Emory group indicated the
improvement of 1.5 Gy-treated patients, the safety of this dose over the
long-term outcome remains a concern. Based on recent estimation of the
risks of radiation-induced cancer (RIC) and cardiac disease, Arruda
et al.63 pointed out that the lung is at the highest risk for RIC. Lifetime
attributable risks for lung cancer with a radiotherapy dose of 1 Gy was
elevated for women >60 years of age and men <40 years of age. Only
0.5 Gy had an acceptable risk of exposure-induced death. Therefore,
Arruda et al. suggested that radiotherapy dose 0.5 Gy provides an
acceptable LAR estimate (1%) for RIC and REID, irrespective of sex and
age. The current ongoing trials should initially use doses 0.5 Gy to
maintain the risks at an acceptable level and include only patients who
fail or do not have any other treatment option.63
Although there more than 10 clinical studies that have carried out to
assess the role of LDRT in COVID-19 patients, most of these studies
(Table 2) were with small participant numbers of 1–10 patients, were not
controlled, and the results were complicated by treatment by other
mechanisms such as remdesivir and dexamethasone.64
Finally, the risk of radiation exposure in younger patients is less well
understood. As such, we do not endorse the use of LDRT for teenagers or
young adults with COVID-19 to ensure a lack of any potential side-effects
for these radiation-susceptible populations. Further studies are needed to
determine the optimal patient populations for consideration of LDRT.
Given the rapid rise and spread of new variants, it may be the time
now to consider using LDR to fight COVID-19, either as a therapeutic
procedure alone, or as an adjunct to other forms of therapy being
tested.64
