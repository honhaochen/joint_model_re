In this work, Yb3+-doped Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 optical quality ceramics were successfully fabricated for the first 
time, to the best of our knowledge. The absorption and emission spectra were measured, spectroscopic in-
vestigations of 1-μm emission were carried out, and optical gain properties were analysed. The stimulated- 
emission cross-sections were 9.7⋅10− 21 cm2 and 3.7⋅10− 21 cm2 (calculated using the Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg 
equation) at 1031 nm and 1073 nm respectively. The calculated values were close to the estimated value of 
emission cross-sections for other Yb-doped sesquioxides. All the results show that Yb:(Gd,Lu)2O3 ceramics can be 
used as a potential active medium for mid-infrared high-power lasers.   
1. Introduction 
Due to the good thermal and mechanical properties, Yb3+-doped 
ceramic laser materials have attracted a great deal of attention in the 
recent decades [1,2]. For commercial high-power continuous and 
mode-locking laser systems operating in the 1-μm-range, Yb3+-based 
laser materials have the potential to substitute those based on Nd3+ [3, 
4]. However, a disadvantage of Yb3+ laser systems is the operation in a 
quasi-three- or quasi-four-level scheme at room temperature, as the 
lower laser level belongs to the ground state manifold 2F7/2 and is 
considerably thermally populated [5]. This leads to reabsorption of the 
emitted laser light and, therefore, to higher lasing thresholds and 
reduced efficiency. 
The spectroscopic properties of the Yb3+-doped host strongly depend 
on the properties of the matrix; therefore, this determines the laser 
performance of these materials. The main feature of Yb3+ ions compared 
to other rare earth ions is a strong interaction of the Yb3+ electronic 
states with the crystal lattice which leads to homogeneous broadening of 
the transition lines and to vibronic features [6]. For example, the glasses 
and disordered crystals or ceramics are characterised by multiple Yb3+
sites leading to inhomogeneous broadening of absorption and emission 
spectra. Therefore, the shapes of the optical spectra and the values of the 
absorption and emission cross-sections vary significantly [4]. 
Due to its unique properties, the proposed new host for Yb3+-based 
lasers can enhance the advantages of Yb3+ ions and eliminate the 
disadvantages. Despite the numerous papers published in the last few 
decades, the potential of the Yb3+-doped laser materials is currently 
limited by the lack of knowledge of the spectroscopic properties of these 
new Yb3+-doped laser materials [7]. Consequently, studying the spec-
troscopic properties of the new Yb3+-doped laser matrix is an urgent 
task. 
Yb3+-doped laser materials can be prepared in the form of single 
crystals [8] by melting or solution methods, in the form of glasses, and as 
ceramics by consolidation of nanopowders [5,9]. Transparent ceramics 
have become increasingly important for applications in which materials 
with good optical properties and high mechanical and thermal stress 
resistance are required [3,10–13]. Various host materials for laser ce-
ramics have been progressively investigated [5,10,14]. Yb-doped ses-
quioxides are the potential alternatives to Yb:YAG for power scaling 
because of their desirable thermal properties. The thermal conductivity 
of undoped Y2O3 ceramics is as high as 12.8 W/m⋅K at 300 K [15]. 
However, the strong electron-phonon interaction causes characteristic 
spectral broadening, especially in the case of Y2O3 with moderate values 
of cross sections [14]. 
The rapid development of ceramic technology makes it possible to 
synthesize RE2O3 transparent ceramics based on Sc2O3, Y2O3, and Lu2O3 
matrices [3,8,10,11,14,15]. Despite this progress, there are no published 
works on the study of Gd2O3-based laser ceramics. The main reason for 
this is the phase transition of cubic Gd2O3 to the monoclinic phase at 
temperatures as low as 1200 ◦C. The phase transition provokes

accelerated grain growth, which leads to pore entrapment, and the 
change in lattice volume causes the sample to crack. The possible so-
lution to this problem is to enlarge the phase transition temperature by 
the addition of cubic oxides with a higher temperature C→B transition 
such as Lu2O3 and/or Yb2O3 and/or to decrease the sintering 
temperature. 
In this work, Yb3+-doped Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics were success-
fully obtained for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. At a Gd2O3 
content in the matrix of 70% mol. ceramics have a relatively high optical 
quality. The absorption and emission spectra were measured, the spec-
troscopic investigations of 1-μm emission were carried out, and the 
optical gain properties were analysed. 
2. Experimental 
Synthesis of powders and hot pressing of ceramics was done similarly 
to that described in Ref. [16]. Briefly, the initial oxides of ytterbium, 
gadolinium, and lutetium were dissolved in an aqueous solution of nitric 
acid. A sintering additive lithium fluoride (1 wt%) and an aminoacetic 
acid in a molar fraction of 1:1.2 with respect to nitrate groups was added 
to the solution. After drying, the precursor was heated in a muffle 
furnace and self-propagating high-temperature synthesis began at about 
300 ◦C. As a result of the combustion reaction, LiF:Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 
nanopowders (1 wt%) were obtained. After additional calcination in air 
at 750 ◦C for 0.5 h, the powders were pre-compacted in a steel mould 
with a pressure of ~10 MPa, and then placed in a graphite mould, 13 
mm in diameter. Hot pressing (P = 50 MPa) was performed using 
home-made equipment at a maximum temperature of 1550 ◦C for 1 h in 
a vacuum (~10 Pa). Due to the stresses caused by the phase transition 
from the cubic to the monoclinic phase during hot pressing, the sample 
split in half. The ceramics were annealed in air at 1100 ◦C degrees for 5 
h, and then subjected to the standard procedure of grinding and pol-
ishing with diamond pastes. The sintering additive was removed during 
hot pressing and was not contained in the final sample. The thickness of 
the sample obtained was 1.65 mm. The appearance of the ceramics is 
shown in Fig. 1. 
X-ray diffraction was used to identify the crystallographic structure, 
unit cell parameters and average particle size. The X’pert PRO PAN-
alytical powder diffractometer with the Cu lamp (λ = 0.154 nm) was 
used as an excitation source. The use of a nickel filter provided the 
monochromatic radiation. All the samples were measured in the range of 
10–90◦, with 0.026◦ steps. The composition of the synthesized samples 
was studied using SEM electron microscopy. The images were recorded 
by a FEI NOVA NanoSEM 230 high-resolution scanning electron mi-
croscope equipped with an EDS spectrometer EDAX Pegasus XM4 (with 
the Apollo 40 SDD detector), with a primary beam energy of 20 keV. 
Optimum resolutions (high vacuum) were 1.0 nm and 1.5 nm at 15 kV 
(TLD-SE) and at 1 kV (TLD-SE), respectively. Beam landing energy was 
50 V - 30 kV, and probe current was 0.6 pA–100 nA (continuously 
adjustable). 
Absorbance measurements were made using in-line transmittance 
and a reflection technique with a Varian Cary 5E UV-VIS-NIR spectro-
photometer equipped with an adapter for reflection measurements. 
Deuterium (200–350 nm) and halogen lamps (350–2500 nm) were used 
as radiation sources. For detection, a spectrophotometer equipped with 
a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier tube (UV-VIS range) and a cooled 
PbS detector for the near infrared range were used. The spectropho-
tometer was equipped with two diffraction gratings – 1200 lines/mm 
centred on 250 nm for the UV-VIS range and a constant grating with 300 
lines/mm centred on 1192 nm for the visible range. 
Photoluminescence (emission spectra, luminescence excitation 
spectra and decay times) was recorded using an Edinburgh Instruments 
FLS980 spectrofluorimeter equipped with two excitation sources: a 
continuous xenon lamp with a power of 450 W and a pulse xenon lamp 
with a power of 150 W. The single and double grating monochromators 
used in the FLS980 are of the Czerny-Turner configuration with 300 mm 
(or 2 × 300 mm) focal length, high optical throughput, excellent stray 
light rejection, and low temporal dispersion. The excitation mono-
chromator was equipped with a diffraction grating with 1800 lines/mm 
illuminated at a wavelength of 250 nm, while the emission mono-
chromator was equipped with a diffraction grating with 1800 lines/mm 
illuminated at a wavelength of 500 nm for the visible range or 1200 nm 
for the near-infrared range. The spectrofluorimeter was equipped with 
two detectors – the Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier for the visible 
range and the liquid nitrogen cooled Hamamatsu R5509-72 photo-
multiplier for the infrared range. The fluorescence spectra in the 1 μm 
region were excited with an InGaAs laser diode (976 nm). In addition, 
the fluorescence decay curves at 1030 nm were measured at 976 nm 
excitation using an InGaAs laser diode. All the measurements were taken 
at room temperature. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Structure characteristics 
Fig. 2 shows the X-Ray diffraction (XRD) of the Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 
transparent ceramics. The XRD results indicated the presence of two 
phases. The first had a cubic structure similar to those of pure Lu2O3 and 
Gd2O3, and the second had a monoclinic (Lu,Gd)2O3 structure. The 
diffraction data were refined with the cubic I213 space group for Gd2O3 
and the C2/m space group for Gd2O3 using Rietveld analysis. The 
structure refinements involved resorting to the FullProfSuite program 
and using the WinPLOTR, and WinPLOTR-2006 applications. The lattice 
parameters were: for the cubic phase a = 10.6864(4) Å; for the mono-
clinic cell a = 3.413(1) Å, b = 7.229(2) Å, c = 8.957(3) Å, α = 98.66(2)◦, 
β = 90◦, γ = 100.76(1)◦. It should be noted that the reflection peaks of 
the monoclinic phase were broadened, indicating a lack of completion of 
the phase transition from the monoclinic to the cubic phase. This fact 
implies difficulties in the calculations of the monoclinic cell parameters, 
as well as the weight percentage of these phases. 
The presence of the monoclinic phases was expected in the ceramic 
samples of such a composition. The same results were reported earlier, 
where the Gd1.6Lu0.4O3 and Gd1.4Lu0.6O3 lutetium gadolinium oxide 
solid solutions have both monoclinic and cubic phases [17]. The full 
transformation from the monoclinic to the cubic phase takes place at 
temperatures higher than 1600 ◦C for the (Lu,Gd)2O3 samples doped by 
more than 40 at. % Lu; that is higher than in our case. It should be noted 
that the SEM analysis revealed no secondary phases in our samples Fig. 1. Photograph of the Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics.

(Fig. S1). The elemental mapping showed homogeneous distribution of 
the Gd, Lu, Yb and O elements across the sample (Fig. 3). 
3.2. Optical properties 
The transmission spectra from 200 nm to 2500 nm of the 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramic samples are presented in Fig. 4. In-line 
transmission at 500, 1100, and 2500 nm was 54%, 71%, and 76%, 
respectively, which is comparable with the other RE2O3 ceramics [18, 
19]. It should be noted that the transmittance of the mixed 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics is comparable with Yb3+:Lu2O3 transparent 
ceramics [20–22]. The dotted line shows the calculated in-line trans-
mittance of the defect-free Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics. The theoretical 
transmittance curve was obtained by the Lambert – Beer law:

where k is the linear optical loss coefficient, h is the ceramic sample

Prediction of the refractive index of the Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 solid so-
lution at different wavelengths was performed using the Drude (or Sil-
berstein) theory, which was developed to describe the effective 
refractive index neff of heterogeneous media in terms of volume fractions

Due to the low fraction of the Yb2O3 phase, the volume fraction of the 
Yb2O3 phase was added to the volume fraction of Lu2O3 due to the 
proximity of its refractive index [24]. Considering the lattice volume of 
cubic Lu2O3 (556 Å3) and Gd2O3 (640 Å3), the volume fractions of Lu2O3 
and Gd2O3 were 27% and 73%, respectively. Refractive indices of cubic 
Gd2O3 and Lu2O3 phases obey the Sellmeier equation [24]: 
1
n2 − 1
= −
A
λ2 + B (3)  
where n is the refractive index, and λ is the wavelength, A is the slope of 
the plot of (n2-1)− 1 vs. (λ2)− 1, which gives a measure of the dispersion, 
and B is the intercept of the plot at λ = ∞, which gives n∞ = (1 + 1/B)1/2. 
The calculated values of A and B are listed in Table 1. However, the 
refractive indices of the Gd2O3 and Lu2O3 compounds can be calculated 
accurately for any wavelength in the visible region. 
The absorption bands in the range from 850 to 1050 nm can be 
ascribed to 2F7/2 → 2F5/2 electronic transitions of Yb3+ ions [5]. No Yb2+
ions were observed in the sample. The most intense absorption in the 
range below 240 nm corresponds to interband transitions of the Gd2O3 
matrix. The lines at 275 nm and 315 nm were attributed to the 4f-4f 
optical transitions of Gd3+ ion from the ground 8S7/2 to the excited 6IJ 
and 6PJ states, respectively. Selective absorption peaks of the host lattice 
cations indicated that the electron structure of a part of the Gd3+ ions in 
Gd2O3 was distorted [25]. We suppose that this distortion was caused by 
incomplete transformation of the monoclinic to cubic phase in our 
sample. The absorption cross-section of Yb3+ ions was determined ac-
cording to the following equation: 
σabs =H/N (4)  
where σabs, H and N represent the absorption cross-section, absorption 
coefficient at a certain wavelength, and concentration of Yb3+ ions, 
respectively. 
The cubic (Lu,Gd)2O3 phase has the cation density of 2.61 × 1022 
cm− 3 (32 cations per 1220 Å3 unit cell volume with 24 in the C2 sites and 
8 in the C3i sites) and, therefore, concentration of Yb3+ ions is 0.13 ×
1022 cm− 3. The absorption coefficients of Gd3+ ions at 275 nm and 315 
nm were 48.5 cm− 1 and 10.5 cm− 1, respectively. The absorption spec-
trum of the sample is shown in Fig. S2. The Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 cubic 
phase has two six-coordinated cation sites, with local point group 
symmetries of C2 and C3i. According to the literature, Yb3+ ions can 
occupy each site. The C3i contains 25%, and the C2 site 75% of all Yb ions 
and both contribute to the total absorption and emission spectra [26]. 
The absorption lines at 975 nm are caused by the 2F7/2-2F5/2 electron 
transitions of Yb3+ ions. The absorption coefficient was 28.4 cm− 1 and 
the absorption cross-section was 2.18⋅10− 20 cm2 (Fig. 6). This agrees 
with the literature data [3,11]. 
The laser properties of the Yb3+-doped laser materials are based on 
the 2F7/2-2F5/2 electron transitions which caused the appearance of ab-
sorption and emission bands in the NIR region. The electron structure of 
Yb3+ is [Xe]4f13. So, the 4f-shell is almost complete with the exception of 
one hole, which is responsible for the simple level structure. Two rele-
vant Stark multiplets, 2F5/2 and 2F7/2 (Fig. 1), are separated by 
approximately 10000 cm− 1; the next excited configuration is located at 
≈100,000 cm− 1 [4]. In a crystal field of cubic symmetry, the six-fold 
degenerated J = 5/2 manifold is split into a Γ7 doublet (2′) and a Γ8 
quartet (0′, 1’), and for octahedral (six-fold) coordination the quartet 
lies lower. The J = 7/2 manifold forms a Γ8 quartet (1, 2) and two 
doublets (Γ6 (0) and Γ 7 (3)). 
Room-temperature absorption and luminescence spectra corre-
sponding to the intermanifold 2F7/2↔2F5/2 transitions of Yb3+ ions in 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramic are shown in Fig. 5. There is a broad ab-
sorption band from 850 nm to 1050 nm, which makes temperature 
control less critical to ensure stable absorption at 975 nm. The measured 
luminescence lifetime of the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ ions in the 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramic sample was found to be 1.07(1) ms (Fig. S3). 
In the thermal equilibrium, the level populations are Boltzmann- 
distributed. In the case of pumping and lasing, a considerable part of 
the active ions is found in the upper manifold. Fast intraband thermal-
ization leads to a separate distribution for each manifold, with most of 
the excited ions being in (0′). Therefore, laser inversion is only possible 
here and laser emission will occur from (0′) to (1), (2), or (3) leading to 
intense emission centred at 9922 cm− 1 (1008 nm), 9712 cm− 1 (1030 
nm), and 9341 cm− 1 (1072 nm), respectively. It is difficult to realize the 
necessary high pump intensities and achieve inversion for the (0′)-to-(0) 
(“zero-line”) transition, which is centred at 10244 cm− 1 (976 nm). Other 
emission lines contribute to fluorescence. It should be noted that the 
crystal-field splitting and the assignment of electronic transitions 
calculation are based on a high resolution low temperature study of a Yb: 
Lu2O3 single crystal [26]. 
At room temperature, Yb has a “quasi-three-level” character; when 
manifold partition functions are taken into account, at least 5.5% of all 
Yb3+ ions must be pumped into the initial laser Stark level to achieve 
gain material transparency [27]. In a “quasi-three-level laser scheme” 
the Yb3+ ions are pumped into (0′). “Quasi” refers to the fact that the 
Stark levels within a multiplet are only “quasi-separate” and are actually 
connected by a Boltzmann distribution. Lasing occurs most readily for 
the strong emission transitions at 1030 nm or 1072 nm between the 
lowest Stark level of the 2F7/2 manifold at 10241 cm− 1 (0’) and the Stark 
levels of the ground manifold at 516 cm− 1 (2) or 879 cm− 1 (3). 
3.3. Emission cross-sections 
Emission cross-section is an important characteristic for predicting 
the stimulated emission for the laser active media. There are a number of 
different ways in which emission cross-sections can be determined. The 
three main possibilities include: 1) the reciprocity method (McCumber 
method), 2) the Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg (F-L) equation, and 3) direct 
measurements of small signal or saturated gain [7,28]. Each of these 
methods introduces a distortion to the calculated value of the emission 
cross-sections, which must be taken into account. Therefore, the emis-
sion cross-section was calculated by two different approaches. First, the

The F-L methods use the emission spectral line shapes and the fluo-
rescence lifetime. One of the main problems of this method is related to 
the measurement errors in the emission spectra and fluorescence life-
time. In order to determine the measured lifetime, the radiative lifetime 
was estimated from absorption cross-sections. The calculated lifetime is 
given by τcal =A− 1 where A is the radiative transition rate for Yb3+ given 
by the following equation [30]:

The calculated radiative transition rate was 1208 s− 1 corresponding 
to calculated lifetime τcal ~0.83 ms. The calculated lifetime corresponds 
well with that reported in the literature for other Yb-doped sesquioxides 
(see Table 2). In contrast, the measured lifetime (τexp ~ 1.07 ms) is 
higher by 23% compared to that calculated [31]. Such difference was 
caused by the radiative trapping effect [32,33]. The difference in the 
values of measured and calculated lifetimes is in agreement with the

literature, where the difference between measured and real Yb3+ life-
time was in the range of 13–21% [32]. 
The main disadvantage of Yb-doped hosts is their quasi-three-level 
nature caused by the thermal population of the higher Stark levels of 
the 2F7/2 manifold. This thermal population has deleterious effects on 
the radiation trapping of the emission by the thermally populated lower 
Stark state, which contains roughly 5% of the 2F7/2 population at room 
temperature [31]. In the well-known radiation trapping effect, photons 
that are spontaneously emitted from the metastable level are trapped by 
ions in the ground state by reabsorption. These excited ions relax by 
spontaneously emitting more photons, which are then reabsorbed, and 
the entire process is repeated [33]. Therefore, the measured fluores-
cence lifetime is longer than the lifetime of a single Yb3+ ion. These 
reabsorption and radiation trapping phenomena ultimately limit the 
usefulness of the F-L method in obtaining accurate emission 
cross-section values, especially from highly doped bulk samples, which 
leads to underestimation of the stimulated emission cross-sections by as 
much as 30% [17]. However, the absolute value for the absorption cross 
section predicted by the FL relation is nearly accurate, and therefore it 
remains a parameter of indicative value. 
Fig. 6 shows the emission cross-sections obtained using measured 
(green line) and calculated (red line) lifetime. The high-energy side of 
the emission cross-section spectra calculated by the F-L theory was 
affected by reabsorption phenomena which caused the lowering of the 
high-energy part of emission spectra, especially for (2F7/2)0↔(2F5/2)0’ 
transitions. The effect of reabsorption can be reduced by grinding the 
sample. Fig. S4 shows the emission spectra of the powdered and bulk 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 samples. On the other hand, the reciprocity methods 
allow calculation of the emission cross-sections from corresponding 
absorption spectra avoiding the effect of radiation trapping [32] by the 
following equation:

where h is Planck’s constant, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the tem-
perature, Ezl is the net free energy required to excite one Yb3+ ion from 
the lowest Stark level of the 2F7/2 state to the lowest Stark level of the 
2F5/2 state at temperature T, and Zu and Zl are partition functions. 
The reciprocity method allows the emission spectrum in absolute 
cross-section units to be calculated from the corresponding absorption 
cross-section lineshape. The required information includes the ratio of 
the partition functions of the lower and upper states, Zl, Zu, and the zero- 
line energy Ezl. Zl and Zu are usually obtained from the energy levels of 
the manifolds and the Stark levels within these manifolds. Previously, 
the values of Zl/Zu have been calculated for phosphate, germanate and 
silicate glasses at room temperature (0.98, 0.97 and 0.83, respectively) 
[32]. While these data are not available for Yb-doped sesquioxides, the 
value of Zl/Zu (1) was used for calculations. Within this approximation, 
the total uncertainty in the σem value was 15%. The calculated emission 
cross-section for Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics is shown in Fig. 6 (black 
line). The lineshape the of emission cross-section obtained corresponds 
well with that reported in the literature for other Yb-doped materials, 
while the strongest emission peak was found at 980 nm [32]. 
An attractive aspect of McCumber’s theory is that its validity is based 
on very general assumptions. One assumption, which is widely recog-
nized, is that there is a thermal distribution of population among the 
individual Stark components of each Stark manifold. Another assump-
tion, not as widely recognized, is that it is strictly valid only when the 
linewidth of each individual transition between Stark levels is less than 
kBT [34]. At room temperature this seem to be a fairly good approxi-
mation for the (2F7/2)0↔(2F5/2)0’ transitions, since typical homogeneous 
and inhomogeneous components of linewidth are in the range up to 35 
cm− 1 compared with kBT’~200 cm− 1. However, the transition between 
(2F5/2)1’,2’ and (2F7/2)1,2,3 Stark level is comparable with kBT at room 
temperature. Because these transitions are so strongly overlapped, it was 
difficult to define the spectral linewidth, and the estimated values of the 
spectral linewidths were in the range of 50–170 cm− 1. Therefore, the 
McCumber transform introduces a distortion in the emission 
cross-sections calculated in which the low-energy side of the spectrum is 
increased, and the high-energy side is decreased [34]. 
The reciprocity and F-L methods of predicting the emission cross- 
sections is largely inaccurate (i.e., by up to 30%). Combination of 
these two methods allows the exclusion of the uncertainty in the 
determination of emission cross-sections in the high-energy region for 
the F-L method caused by reabsorption and uncertainty in the low- 
energy region for the reciprocity method caused by high spectral line-
width for transitions between Stark levels. The stimulated-emission 
cross-section for Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics was 9.7⋅10− 21 cm2 (reci-
procity) and 8.4⋅10− 21 cm2 (F-L) at 1031 nm and 3.7⋅10− 21 cm2 (reci-
procity) and 3.9⋅10− 21 cm2 (F-L) at 1073 nm. The calculated values were 
close to the estimated values of the emission cross-section for other Yb- 
doped sesquioxides (Table 2). The gain cross-section can be calculated 
using absorption and emission cross-sections according to the following 
equation: 
σG(λ)=P× σem(λ) − (1 − P) × σabs(λ) (9)  
where P is the population inversion ratio, P=Nu/N0, Nu and N0 are the 
number of Yb3+ ions at the lasing 2F5/2 level and the total number of 
Yb3+ ions, respectively [9]. 
Fig. 7 shows the set of gain cross-section spectra for several P values 
from 0 to 1. According to the data obtained, the positive gain cross- 
section at 1030 nm and 1072 nm can be achieved when the inversion 
ratio P is 0.1 or higher. Therefore, the low inversion ratio indicates a low 
pumping threshold for ~1 μm laser operation of Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 
ceramics. 
4. Conclusion 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics with good optical transparency were 
successfully fabricated by hot pressing of nanopowders using lithium 
fluoride as a sintering additive. The X-ray diffraction results show the 
presence of two phases. The first with a cubic structure similar to those 
of pure Lu2O3 and Gd2O3, and the second with a monoclinic structure 
(Lu,Gd)2O3. The reflection peaks of the monoclinic phase were broad-
ened, which indicates lack of ncompletion of the phase transition from 
Fig. 7. The calculated gain cross-section of Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics from 
emission cross-section calculated by Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg equation (red line 
on Fig. 2). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,

the monoclinic to the cubic phase. It should be noted that the SEM 
analysis revealed no secondary phases in our samples. The elemental 
mapping shows homogeneous distribution of the Gd, Lu, Yb and O ele-
ments within the sample. 
The absorption and emission spectra as well as decay curves were 
measured at room temperature. In-line transmission at 500, 1100 and 
2500 nm was 54%, 71%, and 76%, respectively. The absorption co-
efficients of Gd3+ ions at 275 nm and 315 nm were 48.5 cm− 1 and 10.5 
cm− 1, respectively. The absorption coefficient at 975 nm was 28.4 cm− 1 
and the absorption cross-section was 2.18⋅10− 20 cm2. The Yb3+ emission 
bands were in the range of 900–1150 nm with maximums of 975 nm, 
1008 nm, 1030 nm, and 1072 nm. The measured luminescence lifetime 
of the 2F5/2 state of Yb3+ ions in the Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramic sample 
was found to be 1.07(1) ms. 
Two different approaches were used to calculate the emission cross- 
sections, namely: (i) the reciprocity method (McCumber method), and 
(ii) the Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg (F-L) equation. The reciprocity and F-L 
methods’ prediction of the emission cross-section was largely inaccurate 
(i.e., by up to 30%). The stimulated-emission cross-section for 
Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 ceramics was 9.7⋅10− 21 cm2 (reciprocity) and 
8.4⋅10− 21 cm2 (F-L) at 1031 nm and 3.7⋅10− 21 cm2 (reciprocity) and 
3.9⋅10− 21 cm2 (F-L) at 1073 nm. The values calculated were close to the 
estimated values of emission cross-sections for other Yb-doped sesqui-
oxides. According to the data obtained, a positive gain cross-section at 
1030 nm and 1072 nm can be achieved when the inversion ratio P is 0.1 
or higher. All the results show that Gd1.4Lu0.5Yb0.1O3 transparent ce-
ramics can be used as a potential active medium for mid-infrared high- 
power lasers.
