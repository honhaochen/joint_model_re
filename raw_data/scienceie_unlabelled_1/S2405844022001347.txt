Lobsters are one of the most valuable and highly priced crustaceans in
domestic and international markets. There are approximately 149 species
of lobsters around the world (Holthuis, 1991). Most lobsters fall under
one of the two families, Palinuridae, known as spiny lobsters, and Scyl-
laridae, known as slipper lobsters. The family Palinuridae consists of 47
species of the genus Palinurus (Holthuis, 1991), and the Scyllaridae
family includes 88 species, 19 genera and two subspecies worldwide
(Holthuis, 1991; Carpenter and Niem, 1998; Chan, 2010; Yang et al.,
2011; Yang and Chan, 2012). Only four species of spiny lobsters (Pan-
ulirus homarus, P. ornatus, P. polyphagus and P. versicolor) and two species
of slipper lobsters (Thenus orientalis and Scyllarus depressus) have been
documented thus far from Bangladesh under the families Palinuridae and15 November 2021; Accepted 2
evier Ltd. This is an open accessScyllaridae, respectively (Ahmed et al., 2008; IUCN Bangladesh, 2015).
Although Scyllarus depressus is a Western Atlantic species, it has been
recorded from shallow rocky substrates and coral reefs of St. Martins
Island, Naf River mouth (Teknaf) and the coast of Bangladesh (Ahmed
et al., 2008; IUCN Bangladesh, 2015). Slipper lobster species, on the
other hand, are bottom-dwelling lobster species that prefer sandy and
muddy habitats and rest in extremely shallow water, as reported off the
coast of Cox's Bazar (Carpenter and Niem, 1998; IUCN, 2015). Due to the
high market price, spiny lobsters are more highly exploited than slipper
lobsters in Bangladesh.
Holthuis (1991) explored the morphological characteristics of adult
lobsters in detail of nearly all marine lobsters known up to the early
1990s. Chan (2010) updated the valid species list with several newly
described taxa and organized all living marine lobsters into four4 January 2022

Md.S. Ahmed et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e08846infraorders: Astacidea, Glypheidea, Achelata and Polychelida. He has
recognized six families, 55 genera, 248 species and four subspecies of
marine lobsters. However, DNA barcoding develops traditional taxon-
omy methods and is useful for distinguishing cryptic or polymorphic
species of marine lobsters (Chow et al., 2006); moreover, it also allows us
to discriminate the species from processed and commercial products
(Jeena et al., 2016).
DNA barcoding is a universal method designed to identify species by
using partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase sub-
unit I (COI) gene (Hebert et al., 2003). The high mutation rate of the gene
between interspecific sequences and conserved regions among conspe-
cifics can distinguish even closely related species (Hebert et al., 2003).
Another mitochondrial marker, 16S ribosomal RNA, is also considered a
candidate marker. As a conserved gene, it can reliably measure the true
divergences between closely related organisms. It can be easily amplified
and successfully sequenced across various animals, distinguishing spe-
cific species (Sinniger et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2013; Chakraborty and
Iwatsuki, 2006; Lee et al., 2014; Vences et al., 2005). The combination of
conserved and variable regions within the same gene makes 16S rRNA
one of the most popular genes for reconstructing animal phylogenies.
There is no published work thus far on the detailed taxonomic
description and molecular characterization of spiny lobsters from
Bangladesh. The present study aims to validate the morphologically
identified lobster species based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I
(COI) and the 16S rRNA gene.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling and morphological analysis
The target lobster specimens were collected as dead from Teknaf
(2046037.600N 9215020.000E), Cox's Bazar (2124015.300N 9153010.100E),
and St. Martin Island (2036049.300N 9219051.600E) of Bangladesh fromFigure 1. Panulirus homarus, Family Palinuridae, voucher ID DUZM

December 2020 to March 2021. Immediately after collection, the speci-
mens were preserved in ice and transported to the laboratory for
morphological identification. Taxonomic identification of the specimen
was performed based on morphometric and meristic characteristics
following the guidelines of Ahmed et al. (2008), Carpenter and Niem
(1998), and Burton and Davie (2007). Tissue samples were excised and
stored in 90% ethanol. Voucher specimens were fixed with 10% formalin
and then transferred to 70% ethanol solution for preservation. The spe-
cies were tagged with a Dhaka University Zoology Museum (DUZM)
voucher ID and kept in the institutional museum.
2.2. Genomic DNA extraction and amplification by PCR
DNA was extracted from a 5-mg tissue sample collected from the
lower abdomen of the specimen using a Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA
Purification kit. The quality and quantity of the extracted DNA were
measured using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer. COI and 16S rRNA
gene sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the
primers LCO-1490 (forward) 50-TCAACAAATCATAAGGACATTGG-30 and
HCO-2198 (reverse) 50- TAAACTTCAGGGTGTCCAAAGAATCA-30 for COI
(Folmer et al., 1994) and the primers 16Sar (forward)
50-CGCCTGTTTATCAAAAACAT-30 and 16Sbr (reverse) 50-
CCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCATGT-30 for 16S rRNA (Palumbi et al., 1991)
genes, respectively. PCR was conducted in 25-μl volumes containing 23
μl of PCR Master Mix (12.5 μl GoTaq® Green Master Mix, 8.5 μl of Nano
Pure water, 1 μl of forward primer and 1 μl of reverse primer) and 100 ng
of DNA sample and mixed and spun for 30 s for homogenization of the
mixture. The amplification conditions included initial denaturation at 95
C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 C for 45 s, 42 C (COI) and 50 C
(16S rRNA) for 30 s, 72 C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72 C for 10
min. The PCR products were kept at room temperature for 15 min and
then stored at -26 C until further downstream application. Amplified
gene bands were visualized in a 1% agarose gel and purified using a_CR_144B, collection date: 28-November-2020, place: Teknaf.
Md.S. Ahmed et al. Heliyon 8 (2022) e08846PureLink™ PCR purification kit. The purified PCR products with DNA
concentrations>10 ng/μl were sent to First BASE laboratories, Malaysia,
for sequencing. Sequencing was performed by Sanger dideoxy
sequencing technology using an ABI PRISM 3730xl Genetic Analyser
exploiting the BigDye R Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit chemistry.2.3. Bioinformatics analysis
The assembled contigs of the gene sequences were prepared by the
CAP3 DNA assembly program using Unipro Ugene (Okonechnikov et al.,
2012). Each sequence was confirmed via BLASTn against the best match
sequences of the nucleotide database (identity cut off 99%) and
deposited in NCBI GenBank. Our analysis includes sequences of the
collected species, along with sequences of the identical species retrieved
from the NCBI GenBank database. All the COI and 16S rRNA sequences
were aligned automatically using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). For the
distance-based method, genetic pairwise divergence was determined by
calculating the Kimura-2-parameter (K2P) (Kimura, 1980) distance using
MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018). The genetic divergence within and be-
tween species was illustrated as a box plot distribution using RStudio
(RStudio Team, 2015). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for COI and
16S rRNA sequences using Mega X based on the maximum likelihood
(ML) statistical method and K2P substitution model with gamma distri-
bution rates. The robustness of clustering was determined by bootstrap
analysis with 1000 replicates.

3.3. Molecular analyses
We generated barcodes consisting of 19 partial COI and 16S rRNA
sequences of the 4 Palinurus species belonging to the family Palinuridae
(Table 1). The average 614 base pair COI sequences ranging from 410 to
679 bp had nucleotide frequencies of 32.25% T/U, 22.23% C, 25.81% A
and 19.71% G. The alignment matrix of the mean 476-bp 16S rRNA
ranged from 275 to 567 bp with nucleotide frequencies of 33.97% T/U,
12.96% C, 31.70% A and 21.37% G. The mean genetic divergence within
and between species is summarized in Table 2 and illustrated as a box
plot distribution (Figure 5). Wide barcoding gaps of 13.54% and 4.043%
were observed in COI and 16S rRNA, respectively, revealing that both
genes could successfully discriminate against lobster species. The
maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree analysis produced three
major clades, where the first group consisted of P. polyphagus, P. homarus
and P. ornatus. P. versicolor formed a second clade, and the clade of
T. indicus was the outgroup. Lineage support was interpreted based on
bootstrap percentage (BP) [BP: 100% maximal clade support, 95% to
<100% strong clade support, 75% to<95%moderate clade support, 50%
to <75% weak clade support and <50% negligible clade support].
4. Discussion
Morphometric key characteristics clearly identified spiny lobsters
collected from the coastal region of Bangladesh (Figures 1, 2, 3, and
4), which is consistent with previous literature (Holthuis, 1991; Chan,
1998; Wahyudin et al., 2017). Among the four species of identified
lobsters, P. homarus, P. ornatus, and P. polyphagus have been nationally
assessed as vulnerable (VU) with P. versicolor assessed as endangered
(EN) (IUCN Bangladesh, 2015). However, globally, all of them are
considered the least concerning (LC) (IUCN, 2021). Moreover,
P. ornatus, P. polyphagus and P. versicolor are listed in Schedule I of
Wildlife (Conservation and Protection) Act 2012 as ‘protected animals’
(Bangladesh Gazettes, 2012). P. polyphagus is frequently observed in
the muddy and turbid coastal belt and river mouths of Bangladesh, as
this is the most suitable habitat for this species (Holthuis, 1991).
Unfortunately, we observed that all of these species are indiscrimin-
ately harvested from the coastal region and trade transpired due to
high prices in the domestic and overseas markets, leading this
invaluable resource to be threatened with extinction.
The morphological identifications were further validated by utilizing
the partial sequences of mitochondrial COI and 16S rRNA genes. The
mean length of partial sequences of COI and 16S rRNA sequences
generated showed AT bias, i.e., high AT content in Palinuridae, similar
to that in a previous study (Matzen da Silva et al., 2011). The mean K2P
divergence within and between species was found to be 0.83 and 17.81,
respectively, for the COI gene. In the case of Indian lobster species, the
K2P divergence within and between species ranged from 0.30 to 0.70
and 15.00 to 26.80 (Jeena et al., 2016). In contrast, for 16S rRNA, the
divergence within and between species was 0.11 and 8.40, respectively,
which was quite similar to the value observed by Jeena et al. (2016).
The calculated K2P divergence showed a significant barcoding gap, and
the progressive increment in genetic divergence at a higher taxonomic
level supports a marked change in genetic divergence at the species
boundary. The lowest genetic divergence was observed between
P. homarus and P. ornatus with a 14.97% distance in COI and 4.9% in
16S rRNA sequences. The minimum interspecific divergence greater
than the 2% threshold also indicates the efficiency of markers in
differentiating congeneric species. The highest divergence was found8
between intergenus species with 19.67% divergence between COI se-
quences of P. versicolor and P. ornatus from Indonesia and 12% diver-
gence between 16S rRNA sequences of P. polyphagus and P. versicolor
(Table 2).
The monophyletic clade of the intraspecific sequences in the
phylogenetic tree constructed based on each marker gene proved the
effectiveness of the COI and 16S rRNA in species delimitation. Addi-
tionally, no taxonomic deviation at the species level confirmed the
authenticity of their recognition. Among the four species compared,
P. homarus and P. versicolor formed close associations within species
with strong clade support of 98%–100% BP in both evolutionary trees.
However, the COI sequences of P. polyphagus formed monophyly with
sequences from Vietnam and Indian sequences with 58% and 72% BP
support, respectively (Figure 6), and the 16S rRNA sequences of the
species grouped with the sequences from the USA and India with 64%
BP (Figure 7). Additionally, the 16S rRNA sequences of P. ornatus
formed a negligible clade with 42% BP support with species from India.
The utility of molecular identification for delineating spiny lobster
species found in Sri Lanka has been previously recorded by Senevir-
athna and Munasinghe (2013) based on partial COI sequences. The
present study enables revision of the taxonomic status of Panulirus
species residing in the geographical region of Bangladesh and their
molecular characterization using partial sequences of two identification
marker genes, COI and 16S rRNA, hence contributing to the global DNA
barcode database.
This is the first comprehensive taxonomic description of spiny
lobsters from Bangladesh, which has been further validated by two
marker genes, COI and 16S rRNA. This baseline integrative approach
would substantiate further taxonomic research on lobsters to under-
stand their distribution, diversity and ecological importance in
Bangladesh waters.
