However , one should keep in   mind that differencing changes interpretation of causal interactions , as   they then reflect relationship not between original time series but rather   between the rates of their changes [ 25]. Repeated applications of dif- ferencing required to obtain stationary data is fortunately not expected   in case of physiological data like ABP and ICP , as that would make the   interpretation even more difficult .

[ 37]. The CBA reactions may also result in byproducts , such as water , which can lead to additional degrada- tion of the polymer matrix [ 38 ] , and subsequent reduction of me- chanical properties , also the subproduct can damage the molding cavity [ 32,39].
[ 45 ] give and plausible explanation to this phenomenon stating that due to the high mold temperatures the cells do not immediately freeze and the continuous flow of the melt removes the surface marks .
The most common approaches of imputing missing data in time se- ries involve linear or non - linear interpolation , sample & hold filters , or  
Hence , these catfish particles help to guide the particles , which can be trapped in a local optimum , to new regions of the search space and thus leading to possible better areas .
Only then the pressure inside the cavity is reduced and the cells begin to grow , in this stage , the frozen layer is almost fully formed , and the migration of cells to the surface is avoided , resulting in a more uniform surface finish with improved rugosity [ 44]. Another commonMIM variation to diminish surface defects is the mold opening technology , which is applied by completely filling the cavity with polymer melt , ensuring higher melt pressure , and delaying the cell growth while the polymer melt in contact with the mold wall freezes , preventing defects caused by the cells .
It can avoid defects caused by melting / solidification in fusion welding and produce very low residual stress and distortion
A minor difference between the two types of data impu- tation is that the interpolation methods are fully deterministic , whereas   replacing missing data by random noise may yield results dependant on   properties of a random numbers generator .
This problem is known as “ nothing at stake ” and can be solved by enabling users to participate in only one of the available chains .

The molding cavity and the screw can also suffer from this reaction and be damaged prematurely , which can influ- ence their durability [ 32,39,40]. This phenomenon can be avoided by the use of PBA , although , requires more capital investment , however , in the long run , PBA will become advantageous when compared with CBA [ 40].

The efficacy of the NCE is actually measured in separate CTs ( i.e. , phase 2 and 3 CTs ) which typically enroll a larger group of individuals , while the true capabilities of the NCE in the real world are measured in phase 4 CTs [ 17]. Detecting the appropriate individuals for potential participation in the CTs is a rather difficult process , due to the research risk ( especially in phase 1 CTs ) and strict criteria that they should often adhere to ( especially for phase 2 , 3 , and 4 CTs ) .

Originally developed in the context of   econometrics [ 17 ] , GC achieved broad application in other fields ,   including neurosciences [ 18,19]. Studying causal links using GC does   not have to be limited to a single organ , e.g. signals recorded from   different regions of the brain [ 20]. Recently , GC has also been applied in   data collected from TBI patients to study causal relations between the   cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , and autonomic systems described by   ABP , ICP [ 21 ] , and heart rate time series [ 22,23].

An important result in the field of quantum computation is that a higher dimensional Hilbert space can be decomposed into a network of qubits and 2-level quantum gates [ 18 ] , and that with at least 3 Fibonacci anyon representations , one can implement the qubits , where the braids of these anyons can approximate any 2-level quantum gate , making Fibonacci anyons a sufficient substrate for universal quantum computation [ 13]. It has been shown that anyons described by Chern – Simons theory at some root of unity 𝑟 can give rise to universal quantum computation for 𝑟 = 5 or 𝑟 > 7 [ 13,19].

In   particular , AFM analysis ( Figure 1l ) clearly showed the microstructure   typical of P400 samples where the height of the crystallites could be in   the range of 50–60 nm .
It should make sure that the manufacturer of a car does n't make any concessions in terms of security .
The methods presented in   the paper should allow for reliable investigation of datasets obtained   from intensive care units .  
The reason for this difference may be that the dominant recrystallization mechanism is different [ 36 ] , that is , the dominant mechanism in region B1eB3 is CDRX , while in re- gion B4 it is DDRX .
For this purpose , the patient is often equipped with wearable or implanted electronic devices , which monitor their condition in real time and transmit their measurements to a master device , such as a mobile phone , while in some cases , they can even take certain actions ( e.g. , try to change the patient 's behavior ) with the ultimate goal being the avoidance of dangerous or life - threatening situations .
