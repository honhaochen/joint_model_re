Nanotechnologies comprise approaches able to synthesize, manipulate and visualize matter at the nanometer 
scale offering numerous advantages, especially in the biomedical field. In particular, nanoparticles represent a 
promising tool in the medical field to overcome antimicrobial resistance, which represent current serious 
problem. Furthermore, nanoparticles use multiple mechanisms to target microorganisms, rendering difficult the 
development of antimicrobial resistance. In the present, we used a Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo) target, permanent 
magnet, to synthesize nanoparticles (Nps) by Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL). To evaluate their possible 
antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Strepto-
coccus mutans, we performed minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) essays. In addition we evaluated their 
ability to affect human keratinocyte cells viability. By time killing assay, we monitored bacterial growth after 
exposure to Nps-SmCo. PLAL is an innovative, cheap, fast and safe nanotechnology to allow the synthesis of small 
nanoparticles that could be exploited for applications as novel antimicrobials.   
1. Introduction 
Bacterial infections represent one of the leading causes of death 
worldwide [1,2]. Currently, antibiotics are considered the main treat-
ment against bacterial infections, but their excessive use has led to the 
rapid emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. Longer periods of 
hospitalization with increasing health costs and higher mortality rates 
are a direct consequence of the continuous spreading of antimicrobial 
resistance [3,4]. It has been estimated that approximately 33.000 and 
35000 people die yearly in Europe and the United States, respectively, as 
a direct result of antimicrobial resistance [5]. This scenario led to an 
increase in public health costs and the drastic reduction of therapeutic 
treatments, causing high mortality in infected patients [4,6]. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) anticipates that by 2050 none of the anti-
biotics currently available will be effective for some bacterial infections 
treatment [7,8]. Several bacterial species are already resistant to many 
currently available antibiotics, including the latest generation ones [9, 
10]. Markwark et al. reported an increased incidence of Staphylococcus 
aureus and Enterococcus faecium strains resistant to linezolid and dap-
tomycin. In particular, the linezolid resistance rate between 2014 and 
2018 was 1.6% and 0.28%, for E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. 
While daptomycin resistance was about 1.1 %, for both strains [11]. 
Cabrera-Contreras et al. monitored multi-resistant S. epidermidis strains 
for eight years (2006 to 2013) in a children’s health care unit in Mexico 
City. During the period under observation a large number of 
S. epidermidis multi-resistant strains with resistance to methicillin, 
beta-lactam, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides was detected [12]. 
In addition to antibiotic resistance, also the ability of bacteria to form 
biofilms has shown to be a limiting factor for use of empirical therapies. 
The worrying scenario described, highlights the need to search for new 
antibacterial agents and innovative therapeutic strategies. Contextually, 
nanotechnologies offer numerous advantages to overcome compliances

associated with the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens [13, 
14]. Nanotechnologies are considered a great scientific advance of the 
21st century, with a deep social and economic impact [15,16]. 
Antimicrobial properties associated with silver, copper, zinc and 
gold nanoparticles have been widely described in literature. The 
mechanisms of action were related to the formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) [17], enzymatic inhibition [18], protein degradation, 
DNA damage and bacterial cell wall destruction [19]. In particular, as 
reported by Pelgrift et al., different types of nanoparticles use multiple 
and simultaneous mechanisms to combat microbes [20]. An example are 
nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticles (NO Nps), which exert their anti-
microbial action through largely reactive nitrogen oxide intermediates 
(RNOS) that react with amino acid residues, Cys, Met, Tyr, Phe of bac-
terial proteins. In addition, RNOS causes direct nitrosative damage to 
DNA including breakage of the filament, formation of abasic sites, and 
deamination of cytosine, adenine and guanine. RNOS, also, causes 
increased generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and alkylating agents 
that themselves damage bacterial DNA. All these multiple mechanisms 
exerted by NO Nps make it unlikely the development of resistance, as 
multiple and simultaneous genetic mutations would be needed in the 
same bacterial cell. 
Loo et al. have shown that the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag- 
Nps) using plant extracts is a green, valid and easy alternative to 
chemical synthesis; it does not require the use of cell cultures and 
asepticity, showing advances respect to chemical methods. These suit-
able nanoparticles synthesized from pu-erh tea leaves extract showed 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Escherichia coli, Kleb-
siella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis of 
7.8, 3.9, 3.9, 3.9 μg/ml, respectively [21]. Samarium-cobalt (SmCo) is a 
rare earth magnet [22]. Currently, no knowledge related to SmCo 
nanoparticles (Nps-SmCo) applied to microbiology has been reported. 
Therefore, our study described the synthesis and physical-chemical 
characterization of Nps-SmCo. Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid method 
is considered one of the promising techniques for the production of 
particles from the nanometric dimension monodisperse. PLAL exhibits 
several features such as stability of the product, low cost, high purity, 
simplicity, good control on the size and morphology of the product [23]. 
The size, shape, and morphology of the nanoparticles produced by laser 
ablation in liquid depend on several ablation parameters, such as laser 
fluence, pulse width, repetition rate, temperature, ablation time and 
wave- length [24]. The PLAL synthesis of SmCo Nps will be discussed 
using X-Ray Diffraction Data, SEM images, Zeta Potential results and 
magnetic characterizations (MOKE). Finally, we reported, for the first 
time, the antimicrobial activity of Nps-SmCo against Staphylococcus 
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus 
mutans. These findings pay the way for the development of new drugs to 
counteract Gram-positive bacterial infections. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Nps-SmCo synthesis 
We used to synthesis Nps-SmCo the PLAL method with these exper-
imental conditions: 
Laser Nd:Yag operating at λ= 532 nm, 10 ns pulse width, frequency 
10 Hz, 40 mJ/shot energy and the laser beam is focused on area (3-5) 
mm2 of the target, the fluence used is 0,8 J/cm2. Geometric set-up: the 
laser beam impinges on target surface forming an angle of 90̊ with 
respect to the surface of the SmCo target. The target material is insert in 
a quartz-cuvette and it is filled with 1 ml Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) 
1x liquid (Gibco-BRL-Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, 
02451). During PLAL process is used atmospheric pressure, ambient 
temperature and the duration time is of 30 minutes. 
The target material to produce Nps is SmCo and the same chemical- 
physical measurements are reported. 
2.2. Nps-SmCo characterization 
In situ measurements with a Total X Ray Fluorescence (TXRF) have 
been realized to check chemical homogeneity of SmCo Target. The 
system for the fluorescence measurements is constituted by a X ray Tube, 
with Ag anode and Be windows with a thickness of 125 μm, operating at 
30 Kv and 10 A. The X-Ray collimator focuses the beam at 3 mm 
diameter on the surface sample. The TXRF data are collected on the 
surface of 3 mm x 3 mm area. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 
is used to assess Nps-SmCo morphology (TEM FEI TECNAI G12 TWIN 
120 kV). Other measurements have been conducted to understand if the 
Nps-SmCo show magnetic characteristics. Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect 
(MOKE) system, has been used to control the Nps magnetic properties. 
MOKE system is based on the Kerr Effect. The polarization plane of 
linear polarized light rotates after reflection on a magnetized surface as a 
consequence of the Spin-orbit interaction. MOKE measurement system 
shows different advantages, such as high sensitivity (up to monolayer 
resolution), spatial and temporal resolution, straightforward in situ 
implementation, relatively easy installation and use. MOKE experi-
mental system is realized with: λ = 635nm, 4.5 mW laser diode, Glan-

Thompson polarizers, Self- made Helmholtz coils (or solenoid), Photo 
elastic modulator (PEM), fast photo detector and Lock-in amplifier is 
used to collect the dates. Experimental MOKE setup is reported in Fig. 1. 
X-Ray Diffraction analysis using a Siemens D5000 with Cu Anode X- 
Ray tube is reported to control crystallographic structure of the Nps- 
SmCo. Finally, the charge present on the surface of nanoparticles was 
determinate using the Zetasizer Nano S Malvern Panalytical instrument. 
The Zeta Potential analysis was measured at 25◦C. 
2.3. Quantitation of Nps-SmCo 
Nps-SmCo were counted by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). 5 
µL of the PBS 1x solution containing our Nps-SmCo were deposited on 
several stab for SEM measurements. About 20 SEM images were 
captured and for each stab, one single drop was deposited on stab sur-
face using a calibrated micropipette and after that the PBS is removed. 
This method we can avoid Nps aggregation on SEM stab. The images 
were processed via Image J. All the nanoparticles present in the images 
were then counted and the total volume calculated by Image J. Starting 
by volume of the single nanoparticle we were able to derive the number 
of nanoparticles in a volume of 5 µL. We have computed that 108 
nanoparticles are present in the 1 ml volume sample. For experimental 
test we used a number of nanoparticles reported in Table 1. 
2.4. Cytotoxicity evaluation 
Produced Nps-SmCo were sterilized for 30 minutes by UV lamp. As 
demonstrated by Dutz et al., ultraviolet radiation does not alter the 
average size of nanoparticles, particle size distribution as well as zeta 
potential [25]. In the present we tested the Nps-SmCo to evaluate their 
antimicrobial activity. First of all, their toxicity was assessed by 3-(4, 
5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay 
after 24 hours on Human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells (American Type 
Culture Collection, ATCC). Cells were plated in a 96- well flat- bottomed 
plate (104cells/well) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium 
(DMEM), supplemented with 10% v/v of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 
U penicillin/100 µg streptomycin, and maintained at 37◦C with 5 % CO2 
[26]. All reagents were purchased from Gibco-BRL (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Then, cells were treated with different 
number of Nps-SmCo as previously reported in Table 1. Dimethyl sulf-
oxide (DMSO) was used as a negative control. 
After 24 h, the MTT was added for 3 h and cells converted it into 
formazan. Finally, DMSO was used to re-solubilize the formazan and the 
cell viability was assessed by recording the absorbance at wavelength of 
570 nm with a Bio-Rad microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Her-
cules, CA, USA). 
2.5. Bacterial strains 
The bacteria strains used to evaluate the antibacterial activity were 
Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis 
strain ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis strain ATCC 29212 and Strep-
tococcus mutans strain ATCC 35668. Each strain was plated on Brain 
Heart infusion agar plates (BHI-agar) (Oxoid, Cheshire, UK) and incu-
bated overnight at 37◦C. 
2.6. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
Antimicrobial activity assays were performed using the broth

microdilution method, in accordance with National Committee on 
Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines, using sterile 96-well 
plates. Briefly, fresh colonies of each strain grown on BHI-agar plates 
were inoculated in BHI-broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 
37◦C under orbital shaking (180 rpm) overnight. The following day, 
bacterial suspension was transferred into fresh BHI-broth and incubated 
at 37◦C under orbital shaking (180 rpm) up to the OD600 value = 0.5 (1 
× 108 CFU / mL). Three serial dilutions were performed to determine the 
final bacteria concentration (1 × 106 CFU / mL). Established number of 
Nps-SmCo (Table 1) were by inoculation of each dilution into a well with 
50 µl of bacterial suspension (obtaining a final concentration of 1 × 105 
CFU / mL). Vancomycin was used as positive controls for Gram-positive 
bacteria. The antibacterial activity was assessed after 20 hours of incu-
bation at 37◦C, measuring the optical density at 600 nm [27]. 
2.7. Time killing 
In order to monitor bacterial growth over time after exposure to Nps- 
SmCo, the time-killing assay was performed in accordance with the 
American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM) 
Standard guidelines. 1×107 (2 × MIC), 5×106 (MIC) and 2.5 × 106 (1/2 
× MIC) of Nps-SmCo and 1 × 105 CFU/ mL of bacteria were added to BHI 
broth in a final volume of 1mL/tube. Vancomycin (10 μg/ mL) and 
untreated bacteria were used as positive and negative controls, respec-
tively. The bacterial suspension was incubated at 37◦C under orbital 
shaking (180 rpm). After the incubation period (0, 1, 3, 6 and 20 hours) 
an aliquot of 50 µL of bacterial suspension was subjected to serial di-
lutions and plated on BHI-agar. Plates were incubated at 37◦C for 20 
hours and the following day colonies were counted to define CFU / mL 
values. 
2.8. Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed by One-way ANOVA followed by 
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests, ad graphs were generated using 
GraphPad Prism ver. 8.2.1 for macOS (GraphPad Software, San Diego, 
CA, USA, www.graphpad.com). All tests were performed in triplicate 
and expressed as ± Standard Deviation (SD).

SmCo, we used Total X- Ray Fluorescence measurements. As reported in 
Fig. 2 a, X-Ray fluorescence showed that SmCo peaks are emitted by the 
target material after exposure to X-Ray beam. These characterizations 
are important to establish absence of other material after laser treat-
ment. During laser ablation treatment to produce Nps, we used high 
laser energy and this experimental condition can produce other nano-
particles inside the cuvette. Total X-Ray Reflection Fluorescence system 
showed SmCo purity, assessed the presence of only SmCo x-ray beam in 
the energy range 5 -8 Kev. We collected the spectra in the range 2-20 Kev 
to control the chemical quality of the target material. The spectra 
showed only characteristic X-Ray emission peaks of SmCo material. 
Theta-2Theta spectra reported in Fig. 2 b shows characteristic 
diffraction peaks and using JCPDS 30-457 and other SmCo peaks appear 
in literature [28], so we can assign the peaks at SmCo material and we 
conclude that Nps-SmCo are random orientation with same diffraction 
peak of monoclinic structure. 
Size and structural morphology of nanoparticles were characterized 
by using TEM as shown in Fig. 3 a. Our nanoparticles appeared perfectly 
spherical with a diameter between 10-60 nm. While in Fig. 3b we report 
Zeta Potential analysis, the data shown that nanoparticles have a 
negative charge value of -28.9 mV and we conclude that SmCo nano-
particles do not form aggregates but are evenly dispersed in liquid. 
In order to verify magnetic properties of Nps-SmCo, we report the 
MOKE experimental measurement. The Nps have grown up on thin 
amorphous film substrate, the spectra showed Nps magnetic character-
istic correlated with particles dimensions, the magnetic coercive Field is 
high about 4.5 mT for Nps-SmCo material, as shown in Fig. 4. 
3.2. Effect of Nps-SmCo on cell viability 
By MTT assay we assessed the effect of Nps-SmCo on cell viability of 
HaCaT cells. As reported in Fig. 5, we can confirm that Nps-SmCo are not 
toxic at lower number of Nps-SmCo tested, showed a percentage of cell 
viability of 100% between 2.5×106 and 0.78×105 Nps-SmCo. 5×106 
Nps-SmCo reduced cell viability of 20%, while the highest number of 
Nps-SmCo tested (1×107) reduced viability of 50% respect to the posi-
tive control. 
3.3. Antibacterial properties of Nps-SmCo 
Antibacterial activity of the Nps-SmCo, against four species of Gram- 
positive bacteria, was evaluated using plate microdilution method. After 
20 hours of treatment with 5 × 106 Nps-SmCo, the growth inhibition 
rate of S. aureus was of 83%, while an inhibition of 70%, 75% and 78% 
was observed for S. epidermidis, S. mutans and E. faecalis, respectively. At 
a lower amount (2.5 ×106), 60 and 58% of inhibition was detected 
against S. epidermidis and E. faecalis, while an inhibition of 37% and 39% 
was recorded against S. aureus and S. mutans (Figure 6). 
Obtained results were confirmed by monitoring bacterial growth 
over time, for 20 hours. Time killing assay showed a similar trend 
against all analyzed bacterial species. In detail, the curve of untreated 
bacteria increased exponentially over time. The treatment with 2.5 ×
106 Nps-SmCo (½ × MIC) did not induce relevant change in bacterial 
growth, showing viable cell counts comparable to negative control. No 
increase in bacterial load was recorded at MIC and 2 x MIC value be-
tween 0 and 20 hours compared to the initial bacterial density,

indicating a bacteriostatic action of the nanoparticles (Fig. 6). A gradual 
reduction in bacterial load occurred after treatment with vancomycin 
(positive control) showing a decrease of 1 × 102 times for S. aureus, S. 
epidermidis, E. faecalis and 1 × 104 for S. mutans, respect to the initial 
bacterial density (Fig. 7). 
Our finding highlighted for the first time the role of Nps-SmCo 
against Gram-positive bacteria. No data are currently available using 
this nanotechnology, to counteract bacterial infections. The mechanism 
of action could be due to the interaction of the Nps-SmCo with the cell 
wall surface, causing a structural damage. Other studies will be neces-
sary in order to address more precisely the mechanism of action of the 
Nps-SmCo. 
4. Conclusion 
This study demonstrated that PLAL is an innovative and safe method 
to synthetized Nps from a target of SmCo, permanent magnet. As re-
ported by R. A. Ismail at al., PLAL is a method that has many advantages 
over conventional procedures for the synthesis of nanoparticles [29]. It 
is an economical system, it can produce high purity nanoparticles, it 
shows a good control of both the size and the morphology of the product, 
preserving the stoichiometry, all with short reaction times. In recent 
years, advances in Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies have led to 
incredible improvements in biology and medicine. Nanoparticles usu-
ally ranging in size from 1 to 100 nanometers have unique properties 
compared to their mass equivalent. They are small agents, whose size is 
similar to that of most biological molecules and structures. And it is 
precisely this characteristic that makes them excellent candidates for 
application in biomedical research in vitro and in vivo. In fact, nano-
particles have different uses mainly in the targeted administration of 
drugs, in imaging, and in their use as sensors [24]. In our study we 
decided to use them as an antimicrobic agent in order to target Gram 
positive bacteria for an innovative alternative therapy to common an-
tibiotics. Indeed the Nps-SmCo showed significant antibacterial activity 
against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, S. 
mutans. Through Time Killing experiments we have demonstrated that 
our nanoparticles are bacteriostatic agents, in fact they block bacterial 
replication through multiple and simultaneous mechanisms such as DNA

damage, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the degrada-
tion of essential proteins, and the destruction of the bacterial wall. All 
these contemporary mechanisms exerted by nanoparticles make it 
impossible to develop resistance because multiple genetic mutations 
would be needed in the same bacterial cell [30]. For this reason, 
nanoparticles could be a valid alternative to common antibiotics, thus 
solving a worldwide problem such as bacterial resistance.
