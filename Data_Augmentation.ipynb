This non - graphitic carbon deposit is significantly more chemically reactive to air than the underlying graphite [ 12,13].

      "skipped In the context of the chemical compass ( i.e. when the task is determining the magnetic field direction through anisotropic hyperfine interactions ) , an analogous configuration ( with only one spin-1/2 nucleus ) has been proposed [ 3 ] , and numerically characterized [ 8 ] , as being optimal : Additional nuclear spins would perturb the intuitive ‘ reference and probe ’ picture .\n",
      "skipped At high burn - ups , i.e. extended service life , oxidation and the associated hydrogen pick - up can be a limiting factor in terms of fuel efficiency and safety .\n",
      "skipped Interestingly , in both methods , the highest computational time ( i.e. , curved vessels ) is not associated with the most complex geometry ( i.e. , patient - specific case of aortic dissection ) .\n",
      "skipped In the literature , there have been many attempts to analyze the growth mechanism by means of pure geometrical considerations ; i.e. , by assuming that vapor particles arrive at the film surface along a single angular direction [ 38,41]. Continuum approaches , which are based on the fact that the geometrical features of the film ( i.e. , the nanocolumns ) are much larger than the typical size of an atom [ 42,266,267 ] , have been also explored .\n",
      "skipped The size σ and energy ∊ parameters are then estimated from the experimental saturated - liquid density and vapour pressure of the individual alkanes following the usual SAFT - γ Mie procedure .\n",
      "skipped For the purpose of this work we will center on a particular version of the SAFT EoS , i.e. the SAFT - VR Mie recently proposed by Laffitte et al .\n",
      "skipped The Mie potential has the form(1)ϕ(r)=Cεσrλr−σrλawhere C is an analytical function of the repulsive and attractive exponents , λa and λr , respectively , σ is a parameter that defines the length scale and is loosely related to the average diameter of a Mie bead ; ɛ defines the energy scale and corresponds to the minimum potential energy between two isolated beads ; expressed here as a ratio to the Boltzmann constant , kB.\n",
